THOMAS THOMPSON</i> was killed in battle near Marietta, Ga., June 22, 1864. The

We provide you with this exchange between Wayne Austin and Dr. Julie Robertson Ashley
which occurred on Oct 29, 2003: Dear Wayne, This is becoming quite a pleasant
collaboration. Yes, I know of Lt. Thompson. I was the one who found his grave
when we first searched the cemetery a couple of years ago. His grave was hidden
under brush from trees and debris, and hard to read at first. But there he was,
a local man who died near Atlanta. A fine young man, he gave his life for the
state of Tennessee far away in Marietta and was returned back to the Brick
Church Presbyterian/Jackson College Cemetery for burial. He served with my
great-great-grandfather Tom Dunlap in the 3rd TN. He was in Company F, formerly
Company E - Captain R. B. McCormick, 1st Lt. D. G. Stevenson, 2nd Lt. Thomas
Thompson, Junior 2nd Lt. G. P. Straley, rank and file 77 men, with recruits.
There is a Giles County TN history website with the information about the unit at: <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~tngiles/cvlwar/3rdtenn.html">http://www.rootsweb.com/~tngiles/cvlwar/3rdtenn.html</a></br>
