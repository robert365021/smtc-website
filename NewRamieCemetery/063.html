</b>The large Beech tree in the center back part of the photo has a row of small
upright stones between it and us. We will document those from the stone closest
to the Beech tree and moving toward us. Looks to be about seven memorials of the
Hickman, Leneave and others.<br/>

A closer up photo showing the our subject row, but the stone of interest here is
the little white one on the ground next out from the tall one leaning to our
right, just before the box tomb.. <br/>
