		As Follows: <br>
		I viewed the Gilbreath-Morrow Cemetery where Mary Richards Gilbreath is 
		suppose to be buried. Mary Richards is the daughter of Aaron and Cloe 
		Richards and was called Polly. Polly and Andrew Gilbreath were married 
		in Adair County Kentucky Dec. 26, 1811. Andrew was the son of John and 
		Mary Coffee Gilbreath. Andrew was born in South Carolina and moved with 
		his parents to Kentucky. Mary died in 1827 as well as I can ascertain, 
		after giving birth to her last child Andrew Farggie Gilbreath. Her 
		husband Andrew remarried and moved to Texas. I do not have an exact date 
		for Polly's birth and wanted so much to find out when I saw the posting. 
		Looks like she may have not received a head stone and is in an unmarked 
		grave. <br>
		Andrew and Mary moved to Tennessee in 1820 (along with his parents John 
		and Mary Coffey Gilbreath). After Mary Polly's death Andrew married 
		Rachel McIntosh (1827)and they moved to Texas around 1846. The 1850 
		Census does not show the Gilbreath's in Adair Co. KY. Mary (Polly) is 
		buried in the Marrow (Gilbreath-Morrow) Family Cemetery near Mt. 
		Pleasant Tennessee near Columbia. Andrew's sister Jane Gilbreath married 
		John Leonard Morrow, thus the Morrow Cemetery. Dennis Richards
