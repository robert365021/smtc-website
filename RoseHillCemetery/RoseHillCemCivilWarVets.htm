ADCOCK, Allen A., 1840 - 1921. Military marker: &quot;Corp Co. I 16 Tenn Cav.
Confederate States Army.&quot; (Note: MCTC states that he was buried in an
unmarked grave about 1986.<br>
pg.60; Allen Adcock of Columbia was among the prisoners of Col. Voorhees' 48th
Tennessee Infantry. His brother Robert of the same command was sick, but
dreading prison hospital remained in quarters. Al drew rations regularly for
himself and Robert, as as Robert could not eat all his, Al his the surplus. He
made a ladder from the boxes sent by friends with supplies, so as to more
conveniently get to his &quot;store room&quot; at the top of his shack, keeping
the ladder hid in his bunk. The plan of escape was to use this ladder for
getting over the fence and then trust to luck. They waited several days (or
nights) hoping that Robert would get well enough to accompany them, but Robert
got worse. By watching the cracks in the oter fence it could be seen when and
where the sentries on the outside met on their beats and reversed. One dark,
rainy night in ______ 1862, those in the secret met noiselessly at the proper
place; when the sentinels had reversed and marched off a few paces the men began
dropping over the fence. Of the MLA Dick McKay, Dave Harbison, John A. Pigg, and
Thomas H. B. Johnson succeeded in getting over before the guards discovered them
and began firing. Those on the inside who had failed to get over slipped back to
quarters. The prison was in a commotion. The officials made a fruitles search
for the means of escape and for those who had been out of the bunks; all who had
wet feet were punished, but Al Adcock had put on a pair of socks over his shoes.
Al was &quot;lying&quot; in his bunk, the ladder concealed underneath, and as
his shoes were dry he secaped punishment if he did not escape from prison. Those
of the MLA who escaped that night made their way south and reached maury County
after a month of great dangers and hardships. After that experience the
officials put a plank walk near the top of the fence so that the sentinels could
see inside the prison as well as outside.)<br>

pg 139: EXCERPTS FROM J.W. MATTHEWS; &quot;The late William J. Andrews told me
that he had that day loaned a revolver to Capt. John G. Anderson, and that as
Forrest was starting up the street to follow Gould, the General took this
pistol; but jsut before reaching the south pavement heard that Gould was
mortally wounded, and with some of his officers, went back across the street to
Dr. Sam Frierson's, who was post surgeon.;<br>
pg.240-241 &quot; IN THE DAYS OF THE PAST - - MAURY DEMOCRAT 8 APRIL 1897. From
the pen of Wm. J. Andrews, who recently died: &quot;In 1864 or 5 Dol. Dan McCoy
of the 175th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, was in command of this post. One day he
received information from Algie Hodge, then a youth, who had been out hunting,
that a woman had been hung on the old Pulaski road. I was then a Justice of the
Peace. The Colonel sent me word to come to his quarters, which I did. he
imparted to me the information he had just received. He also ordered two horsed
to be saddled which we mounted and roade over tot where the woman was hanging.
Around her neck was a limb of an oak tree--which was twisted and tied. Her limbs
and body were lying up against an embankment, and both of her hands were resting
on the ground. The Colonel and myself approached sufficiently near to touch her.
Her hands and face were covered with watery blisters. I remarked to the Colonel
that I was of the opinion that she had small-pox. Col. Dan accepted my
impression and made haste to return to town. Upon reaching town I instructed B.M.
(Dock) Gillespie to summon a jury of inquest and a physician to proceed to the
place to hold an inquest. I returned to the scene with Dr. J.M. Towler, which we
reached some time in advance of the other. The Doctor pronounced it a case of
small-pox and in a dangerous stage. One of the jury coming up in the meantime
and hearing the opinion of the Dr. immediately left and meeting the others
imparted to them the Dr.'s opinion, when all made flight. Arriving in town they
indulged in plenty of corn juice, one expecially, the first who arrived at the
body. That jury became terribly scattered and alarmed. Some time elapsed before
they were again gotten together. In the meantime I visited the Federal small-pox
hospital near by, on the farm of Col. Morgan, met the surgeon in charge and
informed him of the hanging woman. He then related to me that one of the
inmates, a woman, had made her secape about midnight. The while all wer asleep,
the nigh-watch took advantage of their slumbers and went in the spring to
procure a fresh bucket of water. Upon his return the woman was missing. The
surgeon accompanied me to where she was hanging and identified her. The remains
were buried in Rose Hill cemetery by James Henderson in the plot upon which the
Federals were interred. When the remains of the Federal soldiers were taken up
and removed from here I am informed by a gentleman who was present and knew of
her resting place, that her remains were placed in four different coffins. Rumor
said the woman was a refugee from Alabama. She was accompanied by a young child,
and they were making their way to Culleoka to find some relatives at that place.
She was taken with small-pox, placed in the hospital and ended her existence as
detailed, while in a delirious condition. The death of the child followed soon
after, someone giving it a poisoned biscuit inlaid with butter and arsenic, by
whom or for what purpose never came to light. Another killing took place here
while Col. Orr was in command. A federal soldier mounted upn a gray horse rode
into a saloon and with a drawn revolver demanded of the bar-keeper drinks for
himself and several other soldiers, the sale of which was strictly prohitibed by
the military authorities. While parleying abou the drinks a Federal Captain,
actin officer of the day, entered the saloon and soldier on the horse observing
his approach, wheeled and rode out. Upon entering the square he put spurs to his
horse and rode rapidly away. Upon the square and west of the courthouse stood a
flag -pole which he ran against striking one to his legs and came near unseating
him. On the horse flew and the rider struck against the signpole of the Nelson
House, throwing him upon his head and dashing his brains upon the street. The
horse going on, dashed through the doors of the hotel and entered the reception
room.<br>
I never learned the name of the man killed, or the Captain who was the officer
of the day. Wm. J. Andrews.&quot; ) Block C<br>

on coffins for the soldiers who had died here in hospitals or who were killed in
the various skirmishes about Columbia. These coffins were generally made by Mr.
Elijah Neely, who tells me that when lumber was scarce he often made them of old
house partitions and even weatherboarding plank; and finally made them all of
one size 6 feet long, with plain swell sides and at top. Of course, there were
many fine coffins made, as the old account book now in my possession will show,

started for the immortal Cooper [M.D.Cooper, mb] and his comrades. Crossing Duck

usual, led the Major, hoever, losing five of his men as prisoners; the Major
still pursuing him through the cedars. Cooper camped three times during the

Frank H. Smith, Secretary of Maury County Historical Society; PROVOST MARSHAL'S
RECOLLECTIONS, Col. J. Lee Bullock was the Provost Marshal, his office being
where Turner's grocery is now, and which building had not then been lengthened;
in the rear was a little frame or log building occupied by an old negro named
&quot;Gum&quot; Kennedy&quot;. Col. Bullock writes me from Washington that he
had previously heard that Forrest had accused Gould of cowardice, and that the
Lieutenant had demanded an investigation which the General was not inclined to
grant. When Col. Bullock saw the excitement on the street he ran out, meeting
Gould, running and weakening from the loss of blood. Later seeing Forrest across
the street he met the General just as the latter got off the pavement there, and
tried to dissuade Forrest, saying; &quot;I think you need not pursue Gould for I
believe that he is fatally wounded; he is bleeding profusely and losing strength
with every step.&quot; Forrest replied angrily: &quot;Get out of my way, I am
mortally wounded and will kill the man who has shot me.&quot; Mr. A. Nick Akin,
now Clerk and Master of our Chancery Court, says that just then Forrest seized
two pistols from an officer and crossed the street. Col. Bullock says that
Forrest went down the alley to &quot;Gun&quot; Kennedy's house, but learning
that Gould was in the tailor shop, he came back through the alley and went
around to the front of the shop. The late William J. Andrews told me that he had
that day loaned a revolver to Capt. John G. Anderson, and that as Forrest was
starting up the street to follow Gould, the General took this pistol; but just
before reaching the south pavement heard that Gould was mortally wounded, and
with some of his officers, went back across the street to Dr. Sam Frierson's,
who was post surgeon.&quot;<br>

on coffins for the soldiers who had died here in hospitals or who were killed in
the various skirmishes about Columbia. These coffins were generally made by Mr.
Elijah Neely, who tells me that when lumber was scarce he often made them of old
house partitions and even weatherboarding plank; and finally made them all of
one size 6 feet long, with plain swell sides and at top. Of course, there were
many fine coffins made, as the old account book now in my possession will show,

pg. 200, &quot;A Reminiscence -- Columbia Journal, 5 Oct 1900, In the stirring
times of '61 in April, a smooth-faced boy some 16years old joined the Maury
Greys, whos Captain was A.M. Looney. Capt. Looney was made Major and the
regiment camped at Camp Cheatham, Robertson County. Time wore on. Lt. Col.
Sevier drilled the regiment and one day the papers were filled with the news
that Gen. Irwin McDowell had crossed the Potomac on his way to Richmond. The
First Regiment had been sworn into the State service in the Sulphur Bottom by
Bushrod Johnson. Col. Haney had the Regiment drawn up in line on a hillside, to
vot on the proposition whether the men wanted to go to Virginis or not. Major
Looney stood in front of his old company, the Maury Greys, 110 stone. He looked
like a Roman Senator, or one of Napoleon's Marshals. My friends, said he, the
enemy has crossed the Potomac River, and is now marching on the sacred soil of
Virginia, and our little army under Beauregard is too weak in numbers to meet
them, I rear. Shall be we go and help to drive the pround invader back, or
continue to lie here and rot with measles while the noble old mother of States
is being polluted with the tread of the vadal invader; Who wants to go to
Virginia.? I want to go to Virginia, said the smooth faced sixteen year old boy.
I vote to go to Virginia ! That boy was Bill Whitthorne. His cry was electrical.
In a moment everybody was crying to go to Virginia. I remember the scene as if
it were yesterday. We may have to give up our guns, said Major Looney, but I am
in favor of going if we have to fight the enemy with flint lock muskets, or even
rocks......&quot;<br>

was born in the Carter Creek area near Spring Hill in 1808. He received private
tutoring before attending Woodward Academy in Columbia, Tn. In 1823 en entered
the University of North Carolina, graduating four years later. After college,
Nicholson studied medicine and then law, receiving his license to practice law
in 1830. He married Mary (Gordon) O'Reilly in 1829 and they had eight children.<br>
A Democratic stalwart, Nicholson represented maury Co. in the Tenn. House of
Representatives from 1833 to 1837; he later served in the state Senate from 1843
to 1845. He supported Hugh Lawson White in the 1836 presidential contest, but he
retured to the Democratic fold by serving as a presidential elector on the
Martin Van Buren ticket in 1840. In 1840 Governor James K. Polk rewarded
Nicholson for his hard campaigning by selecting him to complete Grudy's term in
office form Dec. 1840 - Feb 1842, when the general assembly would either reelect
Nicholson or select a successor.<br>
Nicholson also served his party as a newspaper editor. He was one oth the
compilers of the Statutes of Tennessee in 1836. He edited Columbi's Western
Mercury from 1830 - 1834 and the Nashville Union from 1845 to 1846, after which
he was selected as a director and later president of the Bank of Tennessee,
1846-1847.<br>
He served in the 1st Tenn. Inf., C.S.A. After the war, he was a member of the
1870 state constitutional convention and then became the new chief justice of
the State Supreme Court, serving in the position until his death on 23 Mar 1876.
He was formally expelled from the senate as were all Senators from the states
joining the Confederacy with the exception of his fellow Tennessean Andrew
Johnson, a loyal Unionist.;<br>

the paper for the evening concluding his biography of Gen. P.R. Cleburne. The
article dealt with the search for the general's body on the battlefield of
Franklin and how from the mistaken information of an excaped Confederate
prisoner the search had been stopped; the finding the body and laying it out on
the back porch of the McGavock house, every room being filled with wounded
soldiers; this bringing of the remains to Columbia to Mrs. Dr. Polk's (where the
Elks Home is now), the walnut casket made by Elijah Neelley, who is yet a
cabinet maker here; the funeral services by Rev. C.T. Quintard, afterwards
Bishop of Tennessee; the mistake in burying among the Federal soldiers at Rose
Hill and the second burial a few days later at Ashwood with so many other
Confederate ofrficers who had fallen at Franklin; the removal of the remains to
Helena, Arkansas, in April 1870, and the honors paid here and at Memphis; the
dedication of the monument at Helena in 1891 -- those and other facts and
incidents were all told in graphic detail by the author.&quot;<br>

H. Smith, Columbia, Tenn, May 1908; .......They were then ordered to
Hopkinsville, Ky., leaving many sick at Clarksville. Measles, whooping cough,
mumps and other diseases unually had in childhood in cities were prevalent among
these soldiers recruited in rural or sparsely settled communities; and these
complaints, seldom fatal in childhood, were virulent epidemics at times in camp,
greatly reducing the effective strength of the troops in the early period of the
was.....Sickness had already so depleted the ranks that Lt. Sparkman returned to
maury County in December 1861, for recruits, and was here sick with measles. On
his recovery, he obtained the number desired, among whom were Geo. McKennon, Mel
Butts, Eben Alexander and others. Gen. W.C. Whitthorne (Adjutant General of
Tennessee) gave the transportation to the state line, they paying their own way
to Hopkinsville.&quot;) Block P<br>

pg. 200, &quot;A Reminiscence -- Columbia Journal, 5 Oct 1900, In the stirring
times of '61 in April, a smooth-faced boy some 16years old joined the Maury
Greys, whos Captain was A.M. Looney. Capt. Looney was made Major and the
regiment camped at Camp Cheatham, Robertson County. Time wore on. Lt. Col.
Sevier drilled the regiment and one day the papers were filled with the news
that Gen. Irwin McDowell had crossed the Potomac on his way to Richmond. The
First Regiment had been sworn into the State service in the Sulphur Bottom by
Bushrod Johnson. Col. Haney had the Regiment drawn up in line on a hillside, to
vot on the proposition whether the men wanted to go to Virginis or not. Major
Looney stood in fromt of his old company, the Maury Greys, 110 stone. He looked
like a Roman Senator, or one of Napoleon's Marshals. My friends, said he, the
enemy has crossed the Potomac River, and is now marching on the sacred soil of
Virginia, and our little army under Beauregard is too weak in numbers to meet
them, I rear. Shall be we go and help to drive the pround invader back, or
continue to lie here and rot with measles while the noble old mother of States
is being polluted with the tread of the vadal invader; Who wants to go to
Virginia.? I want to go to Virginia, said the smooth faced sixteen year old boy.
I vote to go to Virginia ! That boy was Bill Whitthorne. His cry was electrical.
In a moment everybody was crying to go to Virginia. I remember the scene as if
it were yesterday. We may have to give up our guns, said Major Looney, but I am
in favor of going if we have to fight the enemy with flint lock muskets, or even
rocks. Lute Irvine stood above the company and shook his fists, as much as to
say he would fight them with his fist. Bill Whitthorne had on girl's shoes, and
a large flaming neck-tie, and went around the company, crying to each soldier,
Let's go to Virginia. It was a great day, and never to be forgotten. The
regiment all voted to go, and they carried their guns, the incomparable
Springfield Rifle until they surrendered them to Sherman on the 26th of April
1865, except such as were shot to pieces in the terrible battles they were in.
Not one was ever surrendered until April 26, 1865. Signed: AN OLD BOY.&quot;<br>
