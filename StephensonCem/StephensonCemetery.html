<i>&quot;I was taken to the cemetery by Mr. Paul
Blythe Overton, a nephew of Jesse Overton, who is buried in this cemetery. Mr.
Overton gave me much information about the families buried here. The proposed
Saturn parkway is scheduled to pass within a few hundred feet of this place and
the Port Royal access about a mile away. Fred Hawkins, 14 Jan 1987.&quot;&nbsp;</br>

Tommy Stephenson wrote this note 22 Apr 2009:&nbsp;
I believe those Stephenson's were connected to this man in Lancaster County, SC:

</p>
<p>&quot;Moses Stephenson, South Carolina Line,
Elizabeth,&nbsp; R21793, soldier married Elizabeth (--) in 1783 or 1784 in
Craven County &quot;Lancaster District&quot; South Carolina and soldier had
lived there during the Revolutionary War, soldier died in May 1802 in Lancaster
District, South Carolina and his widow applied 26 Aug 1839 in Murry County, TN
aged 76, soldiers and widows 3rd child Samuel Stephenson was aged 53 in 1839 a
resident of Maury County TN, a Thomas Stephenson aged 73 a resident of Maury
County TN in 1839 stated that he was born and raised in Craven County, South
Carolina &quot;Lancaster District&quot; and was at soldiers and widows weddings
but no kinship was given.&quot;</p>
<p>Moses Stephenson married Elizabeth
Dunlap.&nbsp;</br>
We have exchanged messages in the past about James White Stephenson and the
Elkridge Cemetery in Giles where a Barron relative is buried.&nbsp;</br>
[<i>I believe that means the Stephenson's in Jackson College Cemetery are also
related to this group. WA 22 Apr 2009]</br>
</br>
</i>I (Tommy Stephenson) believes the Elizabeth age
88 is Elizabeth Dunlap, if as he says his math is correct:</br>
</br>
Soldiers and widows 3rd child Samuel
Stephenson was aged 53 in 1839.</br>
He has to be the Samuel Stephenson who married Susan Coffey.</br>
I found these deeds at a website called &quot;Blanton Family&quot;</br>
