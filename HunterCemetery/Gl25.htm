There are three
burials listed in Hunter Cemetery&nbsp; located in Maury County, Tennessee. They
are all of the Gilchrist family interred in this cemetery. During 2004 the three box tombs
were removed 70 miles south and across the Tennessee
River to the Old Courtland
Cemetery, Courtland, Lawrence County, Alabama. The Gilchrist lived at least the
latter part of their lives in Maury County Tennessee and are interred there.
Only the tops of the box tombs were moved to Courtland Alabama. The graves were
left undisturbed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Malcolm and Catherine Gilchrist were the &quot;parents&quot;
of the Tennessee and North Alabama Gilchrist. They were listed
in Maury County, Tennessee, Hunter Cemetery in the following books: LUMBER RIVER SCOTS&quot; published in
1942 by John Purcell; THEY PASSED THIS WAY, by Marise P. Lightfoot &amp; Evelyn
B. Shackelford, published in 1964; MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE CEMETERIES, by Fred
Hawkins Jr., published in 1989; HISTORY OF HUNTER MEETING HOUSE AND ITS CEMETERY
RECORDS, _ _? Mack, published in 1983. The Gilchrist are also mentioned on the web
site., Steves world of genealogy chapter 3: <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~steve/robertwg/carolina.htm">http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~steve/robertwg/carolina.htm</a>.
Today 2007 the bodies, history and new memorials are in place in Hunter
Cemetery. The original table top Markers remain 70 miles south. That southern location is in Courtland Alabama
near
the home of one of the Gilchrist sons whose family is interred there. Our thanks
go to
Nelda Stephenson for all her hard work in uncovering the details of what is
where related to the three Gilchrist memorials in Hunter Cemetery.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><br>

Older grave markers found in this cemetery represent a variety of styles and
types common in the 1800s, and early 1900s. They include simple upright stone
slabs as well as &quot;table&quot; &quot;box&quot; tombs. Tall granite Obelisks
and Victorian - era Statuary. Some family plots are enclosed with ornamental
cast-iron fences. Older graves lie mostly in the southern part of the cemetery.
After the Civil War an African - American burial ground was established just
east of the main cemetery. Oldest marked graves in this section date from the
early 1900s. (over)<br>

Marker reading: COURTLAND CEMETERY - 1819 - One of Alabama's oldest and most
picturesque town cemeteries, this site was set aside as a burying ground by the
Courtland Land Company in the original survey made prior to the incorporation of
the town in 1819. Many of the area's earliest settlers and prominent leaders are
buried here, including three Revolutionary War Veterans. There are a number of
unmarked graves of Confederate Soldiers. Three Union Soldiers were interred here
following an 1863 skirmish at the nearby railroad trestle. Their graves were
later enclosed behind a rock wall erected by the townspeople.&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><br>

Stepping forward in time to May 2007 one finds that new markers have been
charitably placed in Hunter Cemetery Mt Pleasant Tennessee consistent with where
the Gilchrist are interred. We post both memorials below in hopes of keeping the
history correctly portrayed on this matter in the future.&nbsp;<br>
