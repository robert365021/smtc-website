<b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000080">Mary McFarland Bradford is the 
daughter of Benjamin McFarland (1747�1823) and Mary Blackburn (1758�1820). She 
was born January 5, 1781 in Jefferson County, TN and died June 1835 in Jackson 
County, AL.<br>
She married Benjamin Bradford (1774�1819) , son of Joseph Bennett Bradford and 
Margaret Wilson. They had these children:<br>
<br>
Alexander B Bradford 1799 � 1873***<br>
James F Bradford 1801 � 1852***<br>
Mary G Bradford 1803 � 1829<br>
Benjamin McFarland Bradford 1805 � 1874<br>
Jacob Tipton Bradford 1807 � 1866***<br>
John D Bradford 1809 � 1860***<br>
Margaret Bradford 1811 � 1856<br>
Sarah C Bradford 1814 � 1840<br>
Jerusha C. Bradford 1816 � 1856<br>
William D Bradford 1818 � 1880<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000080">Many of their children became great military and political leaders. A great deal 
of information is available about them.<br>
<br>
Many researchers on ancestry.com who have Mary McFarland Bradford, wife of 
Benjamin Bradford, in their tree show her death date as July 4, 1838. This date 
is based on a RICE family tree<br>
and a findagrave record that states that she is buried in Witt, Tennessee. This 
finding is predicated on a supposition that after Benjamin�s death in 1819, Mary 
moved to Jefferson<br>
County, TN and remarried almost immediately. These researchers believe that Mary 
married Augustus Rice on April 4, 1821 and had these additional children:<br>
<br>
Harriett Newell Rice 1822 � 1885<br>
Eliza Elvira Rice 1823 � 1834<br>
Edwin Augustus Rice 1824 � 1827<br>
Rufus Eldridge Rice 1826 � 1882<br>
Unknown Rice 1828 � 1829<br>
Amanda Malvina Rice 1831 �<br>
<br>
If you subtract the date of the birth of Mary�s first �rice child� (1822) from 
her birth date (1781), you find that she was 41, and 51 when her last �rice 
child� was born. Nutrition and<br>
fertility on the frontier being what it was, I don�t believe that these 
researchers have the right Mary McFarland.<br>
A more likely scenario is the one that supports this findagrave record. The 
discoverer of this grave literally dug up this headstone in the Roach Cemetery 
in Jackson County, AL.<br>
What evidence is there that this grave is the grave of Mary McFarland Bradford, 
wife of Benjamin Bradford, son a Joseph Bennett Bradford?<br>
<br>
1. That is what the headstone says� Mary Bradford, Wife of Benjamin Bradford.�<br>
2. The dates are very close. The widely accepted birth date for Mary is January 
5, 1781. Jan 1781 to June 1835 is 54 years. Her headstone says she was 55. I 
have the family Bible<br>
record but it does not include Mary�s date of birth.<br>
3. The obituary for her son General James F. Bradford of McMinn County, TN 
indicates that she did not return to Jefferson City, TN. The Benjamin Bradford 
family was living in Tennessee<br>
at the time of Benjamin�s death. The earliest of their children can be 
documented as born in Jefferson County, but later children were probably born 
elsewhere in Tennessee. After Benjamin�s death, the family moved with the second son 
William F. (James?) to McMinn County, Athens, TN to study law with Charles Fleming Keith, 
his uncle by marriage (brother of Catherine Keith, wife of Benjamin�s brother 
James), where �the care and responsibility of sustaining a widowed mother and 
providing for the care and education of a large family of brothers and sisters� 
is cited in his obituary. Please see the obituary attached to James F. Bradford 
in this same tree.<br>

4. Two of Mary�s children and at least three of her nephews moved to the same 
area of Jackson County, AL where her grave is found.<br>
<br>
A. Son Jacob Tipton Bradford<br>
<br>
This item about son Jacob Tipton�s marriage to Louisa Taul of Winchester, TN is 
found in the National Banner in 1829.<br>
Mr. Tipton Bradford of Bellefonte, Ala., married in Winchester on the 17th inst. 
to Miss Louisiana Taul. NATIONAL BANNER (Sat. Nov. 21, 1829)<br>
Jacob Tipton Bradford is found in Alabama in the 1830 census as well. And 
according to the History of Alabama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography by 
Thomas McAdory Owen, LL.D (1933), pp. 196-198:<br>
Gen. Bradford was reared on farms in Morristown and McMinnville , Tenn. He was 
well educated, and settled in Jackson County as a merchant in 1827. In 1832 he 
was appointed register in the land<br>
office at Montevallo for the Tallapoosa Land District, by President Jackson, and 
was still holding the position when the office was moved to Mardisville. He was 
elected major-general of the Eighth<br>
division of Alabama militia in 1836. By act of the general assembly, passed that 
same year, Gen. Bradford and Gen. Crabb were appointed to digest and prepare a 
military code which they submitted in<br>
the fall of 1837. The code was adopted and was known as Bradford's and Crabb's 
Digest. When the land office was transferred to Lebanon in 1842, he made the 
transfer also, but returned to Talledega<br>
County in 1845.<br>
So it can be documented that Jacob lived in Jackson County full-time between 
1827 and 1832, if not longer.<br>
B. Daughter Sarah Bradford Roach<br>
According to �The Bradford Family of Fauquier County, Virginia� by Mrs. Philip 
Wallace Hiden, Sarah, daughter of Benjamin and Mary, married Charles Roach. 
Charles and his second wife Margaret are<br>
buried in the Roach Cemetery in Jackson County, AL, the same cemetery as Mary 
McFarland Bradford. It is assumed that Sarah�s headstone has disappeared over 
time. Like Mary's headstone, it was not<br>
part of the cemetery census. Sarah died at age 26 and Charles remarried.<br>
C. Nephew Alexander Hamilton Coffey<br>
Alexander is the son of Benjamin�s sister Sara Bradford Coffey. The Coffeys were 
already well-established in Jackson County by 1830. Further evidence of the fact 
that these families lived in the<br>
same geographical area is found in the fact that Alexander and his family are 
also buried in the Roach Cemetery.<br>
D. Nephew Benjamin Bradford Coffey<br>
Benjamin is the son of Benjamin�s sister Sara Bradford Coffey. The Coffeys were 
already well-established in Jackson County by 1830. Further evidence of the fact 
that these families lived in the same<br>
geographical area is found in the fact that Alexander and his family are also 
buried in the Roach Cemetery.<br>
E. Nephew John Reid Coffey<br>
General John Reid Coffey is the son of Benjamin�s sister Sara Bradford Coffey. 
The Coffeys were already well-established in Jackson County by 1830. John Reid 
Coffey was a sheriff of Jackson County and<br>
together with cousin Jacob Tipton Bradford who served as land agent, bought 
large tracts of land in Jackson County. John Reid Coffey is buried in the Cross 
Cemetery with his wife 's (Mary Ann Cross') family.<br>
Therefore, it seems likely that single young man Jacob Tipton and his cousins 
moved to Alabama first, ahead even of the 1832 Treaty of Eschota. Jacob married 
in 1829. Perhaps at this time, his mother<br>
and sister Sarah followed him to Jackson County, where Sarah married a Jackson 
County man, Charles Roach. Jacob Tipton moved to Talladega in 1832, but Sarah 
and Mary remained in Jackson County. Mary<br>
died in 1835, and Sarah in 1840.<br>
