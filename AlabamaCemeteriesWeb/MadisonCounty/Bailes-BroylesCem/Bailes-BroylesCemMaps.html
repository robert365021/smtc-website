From Huntsville go out Winchester Rd several miles past Bell Factory to County 
Lake Road and turn (east) right. Go less than a half mile and turn left on Fussy Hill 
Rd. Follow that a mile or so until it dead ends into Hurricane Rd. Turn north 
(left) on Hurricane Rd and go about a mile and turn right on Ray Road. Follow 
Ray road until just before it turns northward (leftward) and turn right (south) on Hearthstone 
Rd. Then that road turns back east and dead ends then turn back 
south (right) then continue to circle the cemetery until you are on the north 
side and you can park and walk down the gentle slope. The Bragg Cemetery shown 
above may not exist or it may exist in a different place from the exact location 
above.<br>

This close up aerial view shows a yellow highlighted outline of the cemetery premises. 
There is a fence today with access from the south side. The large object seen in 
the bottom area is a piece of farm machinery unrelated to the cemetery.<br>
