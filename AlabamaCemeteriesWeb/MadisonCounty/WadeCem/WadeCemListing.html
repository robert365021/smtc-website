<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">WADE CEMETERY (Bob Wade 
Lane) MADISON COUNTY ALABAMA<br>

<a href="WadeCemMaps.html">Mapping the Location</a></font></b></p>
<p><b><br>
LOCATION: Section 26 Township 2S Range 1W. W/2 SE SW. Located at the back of the 
barn lot on the old Bob Wade estate on Bob Wade Lane on the south side of the 
creek.<br>
<br>
Note: There are no remaining stones in this cemetery. The owner of the estate 
told Dorothy Johnson about 1978 that when they bought the land they were told  
this place was the location of the old Wade family cemetery. There were no stones 
there when they bought the place and it is not proven who is buried there. We 
take the common assumption that the Wade parents and unmarried daughters are interred 
here and that the married children moved away to their own new locations for 
eventual burial grounds. All dates are from the censuses or Cemeteries of 
Madison Co Ala as compiled by Dorothy Johnson. So let us continue with the likely 
assumption the David Wade family is buried here - all who are listed are in 
unmarked graves today:</b></p>

Cir 1784 - Cir 1861 living in the 1860, native of Virginia, Farmer by trade,

<br>
<br>
In Spring of 1817, three Wade brothers, David, Littleberry and John, left their 
home in Virginia to build a life on the New Frontier across the mountains. This 
was in the Mississippi Territory 
in the eastern section which would become North Alabama Twickingham (Huntsville) 
and Mooresville were two thriving villages around that time. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
John settled in Tennessee but David and Littleberry came on down to what would 
become North Alabama. David settled on what is known today as Bob Wade Lane (named 
after Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Wade, a son) on a western branch of the Beaverdam Creek, 
while Littleberry chose land over the mountain in the Big Cove area.<br>
<br>
