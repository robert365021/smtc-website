DEMENT CEMETERY, (Research Park Blvd aka Martin Luther King Blvd), MADISON COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>
<img border="0" src="DementCemTopo.jpg" width="421" height="482"><br>
This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Dement Cemetery of Madison Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map. <br>
<img border="0" src="DementCemRd.jpg" width="1515" height="593"> <br>
At the 
intersection of Highway 72 and Research Park Blvd. go north about 6 miles and go 
under the TVA transmission lines. Immediately look to your right at a clump of 
trees due east &amp; about 200 yards out in a cultivated field. You will not be able 
to visit this cemetery except between growing seasons without trampling on the 
farmers crops. Since private land is all around the cemetery secure 
permission to go here, which will also tell you when you can visit this cemetery and get 
along with the farmer who may only be the lessee. You can walk down the Transmission line right of way and 
get closer to the cemetery from the south side. ALTERNATIVE LOCATION: Sec. 32-2S-1W. 
Approx. S/2 S/2 SE/4.<br>

Notice the small red check indicating the cemetery location inside the tree lined thicket 
(as of now small very thick Sassafras trees).<br>

Notice from this aerial view from Google one can get much closer by following 
east down the transmission line right of way and then turning due north (left) 
and go across the field to the thicket where I placed my red check. My visit 
here was between crops so I did not 
have to take the alternate route. Another thing is to visit this cemetery on foot so you leave no 
vehicle tracks that pack the soil down creating a crop growing problem for the farmer.<br>
