<u>Notes</u><br>
Nancy Wright was a cousin to Betsy Wright the 1st wife of Thomas. She was Thomas' second wife 
and bore all his children.&nbsp; The Wright and McCrary's were two of Madison County's earliest pioneer 
families and owned adjoining plantations; their family histories are closely 
interwoven.<br>
<br>

Cemetery for more members of the Wright &amp; McCrary Families.</b></p>
<p><b>All the 
graves here except for Anthony &amp; Eliza Holden were inside the high stone wall.<br>
<br>
The wall was unique 
because its height was greater than most cemetery enclosures. One marvels at the 
weight of each stone block and the labor taken to set them in place given there 
were no machines for that task. The ends of 
each stone were carved to fit the contour of the next one to it and the result 
was not only functional but made the wall a thing of beauty and endurance. <br>
<br>
A 
huge limb from an old tree had once fallen across the wall. This was probably the result of a 
severe windstorm. This violet event plundered many of the stone blocks to the ground. The limb was 
later removed and the wall restored.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Glen D. Estes (Nee Mary Wyche) and Dorothy Johnson author of Cemeteries of 
Madison Co Al visited this cemetery in July, 
1969. Lucinda Wyche was Mary's gr-gr-grandmother. They were delighted to 
find the stones legible after so many years of weathering. The two Wyche graves 
were box tombs. Even though the lids had fallen from place they are still readable.<br>
<br>
At one time the stone wall carried the following Inscription which can no longer 
be found: &quot;The earth within 
these walls is dedicated to the dead therein.&quot;</b></p>
