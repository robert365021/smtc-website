With this map I show the route to the cemetery as I was escorted by the land 
owner. A more direct route to travel to the junction of A. Smith Rd and Riverton 
Rd and with permission walk along the north edge of the hedge row going east and 
when it ends turn left (north) and follow the hedge row about 70 yards and then 
turn east and with equipment cross the fence without damaging it into the grove 
of trees where the cemetery will be due east of you 30 yards as seen in the 
bottom aerial map. This cemetery is not mapped by the USGS<br>

From Huntsville go out Winchester Rd several miles and turn north (left) on 
Riverton Road. Go about a mile to the end of to the junction of A. Smith Rd (on 
your left) and Riverton Rd and with permission walk along the north edge of the 
hedge row going east and when it ends turn left (north) and follow the hedge row 
about 70 yards and then turn east and with equipment cross the fence without

This close up aerial view shows a red check in the center of the cemetery 
premises. If one wishes to drive to the cemetery, approach the owner in dry 
weather and the field road is passable all the way from the north of here, but 
the land owner that way will likely insist on accompanying you as there are 
cattle all around which should not be disturbed.<br>
