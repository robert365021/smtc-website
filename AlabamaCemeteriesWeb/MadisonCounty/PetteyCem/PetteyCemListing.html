Three sets of initials etched in the concrete when it was set many years ago, 
before 1970. Don't know if these are from the Daughters of the American 
Revolution ladies, or some of the 
descendents that sealed this cemetery, or just some nub heads that happened along 
before the concrete dried. Anyway their tribute-initials: W.R.S.; J.E.P.; A.D.S.:</font></b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><a href="IMG_1628.JPG">1628</a></font><b><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

</font></i><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">This two-grave cemetery is 
located 3/5 of a mile south Of Bloucher-Ford cemetery on the east side of the 
road, and approximately 1 mile north of the McCrary-Wright Cemetery. The graves 
are located on the bank of the road and the bank has been reinforced with cement 
and rocks to keep it from washing away around the graves, William Pettey 
purchased the NW 1/4 of Section 14, covering 160 acres (where this cemetery is 
located) in 1815. There is a wet weather branch running thru there on its way to 
empty into the Flint River.<br>
<br>
Any other graves represented as being here must be backed up with facts. There 
is no visual evidence of other graves being here. There are footstones in place 
for each of these graves which have been broken off probably by farm equipment 
in the past. One with the initials W.R. for William Pettey. The other one's top 
is missing.</font></font></b></p>
