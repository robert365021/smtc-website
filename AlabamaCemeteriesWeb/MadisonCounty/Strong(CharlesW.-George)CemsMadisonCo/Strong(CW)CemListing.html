	</b>*Charles W. Strong built the fine old home which sits on the hill top Just 
	northeast of the Cemetery. He was the son of George and Sally Strong who 
	came to Alabama with their<br>
	children prior to 1820. Many descendants of this pioneer family still Live 
	in Madison County today.<br>
	<b>
	<br>
	</b>I was told by an old timer next door that the land for this cemetery was 
	deeded to the county when they subdivided it years ago. Indeed one 
	can tell the lot fronting the road is a separate entity.<br>
	This cemetery has been torn up and displaced badly. None of the stones are 
	in their original positions. They should all be facing east/west and about 8 
	feet between the footstones and headstones with the graves in between. I 
	could only find one footstone. Vandals/Trees &amp; Farm animals can do this kind 
	of damage, but vandals are the worst because they break the stones into 
	pieces and then often toss the parts around. I pray to my God I never catch one 
	of them because the punishment would not fit the crime even though it would 
	to me. The way one can tell a vandal (of long ago) is the parts of the stone 
	are never found whereas in other events the stone fragments are usually lying 
	around, often under the soil though.<br>

Powell, whose family cemetery this is, that Pleasant Strong was buried in this 
cemetery without a headstone. Also that Mary &quot;Polly&quot; East was buried here 
without a headstone. If Polly East Is buried here then I expect her husband, 
George Strong, is also buried here. <br>

I visited this cemetery and could find no formal monuments. I could not even get 
into the area very well to do a proper investigation. All I could see when I peeped into 
the thicket was dense piles of Vines, brush &amp; piles of rocks as if there was an attempt to bull 
doze debris and pile it up in a big pile. In talking to the neighbors I find this 
area was also hit hard by the awful Tornados of 27 Apr 2011. There are old 
twisted &amp; knarled trees inside this thicket to support this. If so this cemetery 
could be permanently destroyed by that violet event. This is probably the same 
tornado that hit&nbsp; my street due east of this spot about 10 miles and it was about an F1. Large trees falling 
around leave big sinks where root balls flip up into the air and cover everything 
around them. Tombstones then fall into the pits created by this event. At first 
I thought I 
was possibly wrong about the location of this cemetery but it is clearly marked 
on historical topographical maps so this is the site. Maybe if a crew went in 
there and pulled away all those piles before they all decay and dissolve back to the ground some 
of this cemetery could be preserved. The only thing clear here is that nature is 
designed to break down everything and render it back to the soil and if my 
theory is correct it did so in a very violet way. Thank God for previous 
researchers such as Dorothy Johnson &amp; others.</font></b></font></p>
