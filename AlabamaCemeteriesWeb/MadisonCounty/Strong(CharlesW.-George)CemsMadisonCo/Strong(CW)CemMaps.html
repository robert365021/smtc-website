This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Charles W. Strong Cemetery of Madison Co. Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map marked with the red check as N 34.81581 X W 86.57284. Specific 
Location: Section 36 Township 2S Range 1W. SE SE SE. on Mt. Charron Rd NW on the 
left about 70 yards from the road, just off North Memorial Parkway in a clump of 
trees and brush. Go past one house on the right and the cemetery occupies the 
next lot grown up in back. It is about 75 yards from the road and about 1/3 to 
1/2 the distance east from the house on your right as you face the cemetery 
thicket.<br>

At the 
intersection Winchester Rd and Hwy 231/431 go north to Mt Charron NW and turn 
left. The cemetery lot is the second lot but just past the first house on your 
left.<br>

Mt Charron Rd is a loop road so pass the first entrance and turn into the second 
one.<br>
This zoomed in map with a red check shows where the cemetery can be found in 
the tree lined thicket. It is not kept up, but the front of the lot is kept 
mowed somewhat.<br>
