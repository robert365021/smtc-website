This cemetery is on the verge of destruction. The one large 
monument is predominant and is in danger of tumbling into the bank. The small 
stones are broken and I found one stone being used as a fill to stop erosion 
under a nearby fence. Condensed and edited from Dorothy Johnson's commentary 
1989. When there I ask permission of the lady to visit this cemetery, however I 
soon realized another member of the family stood out on the grounds in the 
distance with a mean looking bull dog and stared at me as I cleared enough to 
make the photos. I was unaware of his motives, but was a bit unnerved by his 
actions. but finished and cleared the premises.<br>
