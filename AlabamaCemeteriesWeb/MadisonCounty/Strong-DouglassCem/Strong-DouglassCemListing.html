I recently visited this mapped place in attempting to find this cemetery 
and was disappointed to find nothing but a large open field with no sign of a 
cemetery. It appears not to be here anymore or possibly it was miss-mapped. It 
probably has been destroyed by the current owner who recently added giant 
irrigation equipment, because Google Maps show a recent massive land moving 
operation here. He evidently bulldozed the cemetery to clear the area for the 
equipment. The mapping I have shown under &quot;Mapping the Location&quot; shows no conclusion as to the location of the 
cemetery, but shows it in two places out in the giant field as shown in these 
two maps and next to the Pulaski Pike. I saw no evidence it was in either 
location. However, I did not get a good look, because of the idiot below. <br>

When I went into the area to inquire for permission to seek the whereabouts of 
the cemetery a man bearing a large rifle confronted me and said to leave 
immediately, in spite of the fact that there is a law in Alabama allowing folks 
to visit a cemetery. Naturally this is about science and family history and not 
confrontations using firearms so I left. I will measure my efforts to see if I 
want to pursue any recourse on this matter given that all we want is to find the 
cemetery and photograph the stones. We can do that without leaving a footprint - 
that is not harming anyone's private property or crops. After all this cemetery 
deserves to survive for posterity. <br>
Being the pleasant gentleman I am I just wanted out of there with no 
confrontaton involving this individual or the authorities because that waste my 
valuable time and theirs too, but 
I should warn others to not go on this property attempting to get permission to 
visit this cemetery as you could be hurt by an irate eccentric individual. Go 
there only with the authorities if you go.<br>
