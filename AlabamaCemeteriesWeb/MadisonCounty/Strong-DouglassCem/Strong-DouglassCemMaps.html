This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Strong-Douglass Cemetery of Madison Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map marked with the white check. However there does not appear to 
be a cemetery at this location. LOCATION: Section 6 Must actually be 16) 
Township 2, Range 1 east C. E/2 NW/4. In the valley a quarter of a mile east of 
the big curve in Meridian Pike aka Monroe Road before it meets with Highway 
231/431 north of Huntsville, Alabama.<br>

Go out Pulaski Pike and pass Monroe Road and look right or east into a giant 
field where two ponds exist. I recently visited this mapped place in attempting 
to find this cemetery and was disappointed to find nothing but a large open 
field with no sign of a cemetery. It appears not to be here anymore or possibly 
it was miss-mapped. It probably has been destroyed by the current owner who 
added giant irrigation equipment recently. He evidently bulldozed the cemetery 
to clear the area for the equipment. The mapping I have shows no conclusion as 
to the location of the cemetery, but shows it in two places out in the giant 
field as shown in these two maps and next to the Pulaski Pike. I saw no evidence 
it was in neither location. However, I did not get a good look. <br>
