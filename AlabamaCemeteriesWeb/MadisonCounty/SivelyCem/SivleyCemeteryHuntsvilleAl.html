Note: To the north of these graves, but in the same general area and now inside
the cemetery fence, are the two small Hale family marble markers and the Crews
family Marker. They are not believed to relate to the Sivley family. The Rhoda
Jane Hale marker was not found in the 2010 visit so we relied upon previous
researchers for that listing. Here is what is found in the north section of the
cemetery:<br>

 John Hunt was the first settler of Huntsville, he settled on the bluff above Big
Springs.&nbsp; He is believed to have founded Huntsville and may be buried here.
Some notable Huntsville historians such as Jim Maple believe that it is
likely John Hunt is also buried here in an unmarked grave. In
his later years John went to live with his daughter whose place was next to the
Sivleys' where he died. He could very well have also been buried here. No one knows of his grave
location.<br>
