long north south tract of the cemetery with plenty of room for unmarked graves.
There is a story of buried treasure being uncovered here that I chose not to
tell because some idiot will think they can go digging here and find something.
The only thing they will do is desecrate the graves here. Do not be caught
digging in this cemetery or you will be prosecuted by the law. Cameras will
catch you mounted on the buildings across the fence for security purposes.<br>

This southward photo give one a sense of how long this cemetery is with plenty
of open space for unknown graves. Also it may be that though there are five
names inscribed on one monument the graves may be in a row down this way.<br>

This southeast photo gives one a sense of how long this cemetery is with plenty

Panning the camera left more yields this photo in a more eastward shot. We see
the entrance monument and the Crews memorial under the cedar trees.<br>
