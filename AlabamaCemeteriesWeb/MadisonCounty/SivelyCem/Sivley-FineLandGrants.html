<b><br>
These grants were for a block of land probably given for services these men gave
as soldiers. They were for three quarters of section 13 of the Township 4,South,
Range 1. No mention of the disposition of the northeast quarter above.</b><br>
<img border="0" src="Img_5802--.jpg" width="1411" height="1125"><br>
I have highlighted the area of these land grants above.<br>
The yellow square is the one for Andrew Sivley which was the northwest quarter.<br>
The bluish purple square is the one for father Jacob Sivley which was the
southwest quarter.<br>
The greenish square is the one for son-in-law William Fine which was the
southeast quarter.<br>
This is a 1909 map of Huntsville so it does not relate to the period of these
grants, but the location is the same. Notice the land belongs then to W.F. Garth
above. This map shows he landowners in the various section quarters. Believe the
Garth family purchased this land sometimes after the Sivley family died, sold
out or moved away. William Fine sold his interest and moved to Giles County and
later on to Crawford County Arkansas where he &amp; his wife Catherine Sively
lived the remainder of their lives and died there. One daughter of William &amp;
Catherine Fine who was Elizabeth married into the Coffee family, a prominent
south Maury County named Calvin Coffee, the son of Nathan &amp; Elizabeth
Gilbreath Coffee.<br>
Section 13 as the location of the Sivley Cemetery.<br>
Notice the Merrimac Village is located just northwest of these land grant
locations. The Red/Blue snaky north/south line is the Huntsville Spring Branch
or Canal which flows from Big Spring in the center of Huntsville. Huntsville
grew up around that spring and today it is a major Park &amp; commercial
center.&nbsp;<br>
