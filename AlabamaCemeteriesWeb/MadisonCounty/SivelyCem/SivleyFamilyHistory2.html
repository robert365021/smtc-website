Historical Record of Virginians in the Revolution, 1799: Jacob Seveley in 4th,
8th 12th Continental Line.<br>
<br>
Sometime prior to 1808, Jacob and his family came from Virginia to Tennessee and
must have lived there for a while. Jacob's grandson, Hamilton (Andrew's son) was
born near Knoxville, January 1, 1807.<br>
<br>
Jacob moved from Pennsylvania to Virginia, then he moved to Tennessee and later
to Alabama. All of his children are believed to have been born in Virginia
(except perhaps, Jacob Jr.) About 1809 he brought his entire family down the
Tennessee River from Virginia on flat boats. Andrew's second son, Rawley was
born on a flat boat in March of that year. They settled south of Huntsville
Alabama on Indian Creek, on the stagecoach road, running from the river to
Huntsville. The big spring made a canal, flowing into a creek which emptied in
the river and small boats came up and down this stream to the new settlement. It
ran through the land where the Sivleys settled. Jacob had a large plantation and
many slaves. After his death his children sold their part of the land to one of
his older sons, Andrew. He paid them $314 each according to court documents.
Wife of first son, Joseph (her name was Rachel) used her money and moved her
family to Lawrence County, Alabama. She is the first Sivley to appear in
Lawrence County, AL census. Census indicates she had seven children and owned
one slave.<br>
<br>
Eventually they all drifted elsewhere. One to Texas, one to Mississippi and the
rest unknown. There was a Sivley cemetery on Triana road near their old home in
Huntsville where Jacob and Alcey are buried. Over the years their head stone
disappeared, but some of the descendants of Luther Sivley (John Clinton's
brother) had a stone erected showing that Jacob had been a Revolutionary
soldier.<br>
<br>
<br>
1809 Madison County census lists Andrew Sivley, wife, two small children and two
other males over 21 years of age. Of those two one was probably Jacob and the
other one possibly Joseph or Jessie.<br>
<br>
It has been reported that Jacob and his oldest son, Andrew, acquired land grants
from the government adjoining each other then they worked together to carry on
their interests, covering much of the site which is now known as Merrimack
Village. Up until 1932 the two Sivley homes were apparently among the oldest in
Madison County. One was a frame structure and the other a massive brick built
around a winding staircase and harboring a buried treasure which brought a
family descendant back in search of it. These homes stood out as the most
striking of Madison County estates. The frame house, built on a rise near a
stream, is believed to have been Jacob's. All uprights and beams were fashioned
from cedar logs, the building was oblong with tall chimneys at each end. It had
four rooms and from these Jacob directed his slaves in their work about his farm
called &quot;St. Andrew Plantation&quot;. Jacob was so stout he had a special
bed, chair and carriage made for him. He could not stoop to tie his shoes and
so, therefore, had one of his slaves with him at all times. When he died a
coffin was made six feet long at a cost of $2.00 per foot. It was made of planed
boards and fitted with iron handles like the others of that time. He was buried
in what was to be the family burial ground near the home, the first known Sivley
to be laid to rest in the new territory, which had not become a state yet.<br>
<br>
From &quot;Historic Homes&quot; by Pat Jones 12-11-1932:<br>
&quot;Apparently one of the oldest homes in Madison county, built some time
after 1809 around a winding stairway and harboring a buried treasure which
brought a family descendant all the way from Chicago in search of it--these
features make the Sivley home a mile southeast of Merrimack stand out as the
most striking of local estates.<br>
<br>
&quot;Once an important mansion in the lives of Huntsville's first settlers,
this home is forgotten now. Few county residents know of its existence. At its
point beside the Big Spring branch, midway between Merrimack and Whitesburg
pike, passerby are few, and those who stop to view it find nothing to indicate
its part in history.<br>
<br>
&quot;The whole atmosphere of the home suggests feudal England. It stands
barren-like on a knoll, in next to the last stages of ruin, without even a shade
tree to break the force of the wind sweeping across the fields that lead up to
the mountains to the south and west.<br>
<br>
&quot;In reviewing this home, two houses must be considered, one a frame
structure, the other a massive brick. Which of these was built first is not
known, but it seems likely that the frame superceded the other, for brick was
given the preference in location, standing a few feet to the front of the other.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Sivleys according to tradition, came to Alabama from Tennessee in
1809, floating down the river on a flatboat. The family came originally from the
Dutch colony in Pennsylvania, settling next in Hanover or King William county,
Virginia and then moving south.<br>
<br>
&quot;Four brothers, Andrew, Joseph, Jacob and Jesse and their wives are
supposed to have come down on this migration. The father, Jacob Sivley, however
must have accompanied them or followed shortly afterward, for he and his elder
son, Andrew, then 26 years old, acquired grants adjoining each other, from the
government on August 28 of the year they arrived.<br>
<br>
&quot;Assuming that the frame house is the older, this was built by Jacob on a
rise beside the Big Spring branch, a small stream of clear water. All uprights
and beams in the structure were fashioned from cedar logs. Other lumber used was
from yellow poplar. This building was oblong in shape, with a tall chimney at
each end, had four rooms and was simple in construction. From these quarters
Jacob was to direct his slaves in their work about his farm, named the St.
Andrew plantation.<br>
<br>
&quot;The son, on the other hand, built his home across the stream from the
father. In addition, he put up a dam nearby and formed a pond to supply water
for his grist mill, which was to be his chief means of livelihood. This was the
beginning of 'Sivley's Mill', as it has been known even to the present
generation.<br>
<br>
&quot;The father and son worked together ideally to carry on their interests in
that section, covering much of the site of the present Merrimack village.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jacob died in 1816. The following receipt was given his son-in-law,
William Fine, on Sept. 20 of that year in answer to a bill from William N.
Smith:
'To a coffin, six feet, at $2 a foot, $12.' This box, like all others of those
pioneer days, was made of planed boards and fitted with iron handles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two years later, Jacob's estate was bought by Andrew. This deed, signed by
his heirs, follows in part: 'Joseph Sivley and wife, Rachel, William Smalling
and wife, Nancy, John Sivley and wife, Elizabeth, Jesse Sivley and wife,
Elizabeth, Bannister Bond and wife, Peggy, all of Madison county. Thomas Evans
and wife, Peggy, of Limestone county. William Fine and wife Catherine of Giles
county, Tennessee, Eliathan Davis and wife, Rebecca of Rutherford county,
Tennessee, which said Joseph Sivley, Nancy Smalling, Catherine Fine, John Sivley,
Elizabeth Evans, Jesse Sivley, Peggy Bond, Rebecca Davis are children of late
Jacob Sivley, to Andrew Sivley, Nov. 19, 1818.'<br>
<br>
&quot;One noticeable feature of this record, still well preserved, is that the
daughters were unable to sign their names, using an X with a witness as their
signature, due evidently to a belief in those days that education was not needed
by a woman, as she was cut out only to become the wife of a man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Around this time seems most likely to have been the date at which the
brick home was erected on a rise nearby, and with a better view than that of the
frame structure. Both were somewhat similar in outward construction, but were
vastly different on the inside.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the basement of this finer home were arranged three rooms, all well
finished. One of these, that at the west end was set-aside as the kitchen. Its
fireplace, half the width of the room, was large enough to roast a large section
of beef at one time. Entrance to the cellar was gained through a door at the
west end of the house.<br>
<br>
&quot;Food was taken from the kitchen up a stairway to the dining room above,
which had a cupboard sbuilt into the wall in its northwest corner. Another
stairs led from this chamber to the top floor, allowing passage up and down
without entering the other part of the home.<br>
<br>
&quot;The main door of the building faced the north, toward Huntsville. This was
in two panels below an arch of brick. Upon entering the home visitors found
themselves in a barrel-shaped hallway, easily 30 feet from its bottom floor to
its ceiling. Near the entrance, a winding stairway began its circuitous route to
the upper landing, passing just above the door at the opposite side of the
house. This was without a doubt, the most picturesque stairway in Madison
County.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two large rooms were located on each side of the hall, one above the
other. These measured 20 feet in dimensions, with ceilings 15 feet high. Large
windows allowed a view to the north and south.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fireplaces were built in each room. That in the upper chamber to the east
was of an odd arrangement, facing obliquely to the center. On one side it was
flush with the wall, while on the other its corner stood four feet out in the
floor. This probably was so arranged in order that a fire burning on the hearth
would not reflect in the eyes of a person sleeping in the section outside the
scope of the light.<br>
<br>
&quot;Three porches, a long one on the north, and a smaller on each of the south
and west sides, set off the outer appearance of the building.<br>
<br>
&quot;In 1832 Andrew sold a tract of land, on which was located the mill pond,
to James ? Martin. This sale was made on the condition that the canal boats
would be allowed to pass and that the company be permitted to use water from
this source to fill its lock. Furthermore, Sivley was to retain the right to
water his stock from the lake.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shortly after the middle of the century, Andrew, approaching the age of
70, felt that his days were numbered. Rebecca, too, was climbing in age and
showing a feebleness that urged her older husband to relieve her of all
responsibilities and worries. So he made plans for their retirement.<br>
<br>
&quot;In 1853 he sold the plantation containing 750 acres to his son, Joseph,
for &amp;15,000. This change of property was made on the condition that the
buyer would take care of his parents as long as they lived. The mill was
included in the sale.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then came his will. Andrew had 11 (10?) children, as follows:<br>
Elvira, 1813-1833, who married a Mr. Cooper; Deborah, married Jack Harris and
lived near Gunthaven, Mississippi; Hamilton, born 1807, married Sarah Jane
Baker; George W., 1820-1857; Lucy C., 1822-1834; Rawley, born on the flatboat
while his parents were on their way to Alabama, married Eliza Jane Burleson and
lived near Raymond, Mississippi; William B., 1826-1840; Martin; Joseph, married
Clara Marshall of Alabama. Elvira first married to a Mr. Wallace, later to
Oliver Vassar Shearer of near Birmingham. The name of the 11th child is not
known.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of these children, only four were mentioned in the will, the others either
having died or severed connections with the parent.<br>
<br>
&quot;According to his will, Andrew left his wife, the former Rebecca Denton 11
negro slaves and the furniture of the home, specifying that the slaves were to
be divided among the children upon her death. His three grandchildren by the
name of Sivley, all descended from Jacob, were willed $1000 each. The four
resulting from the marriage of his daughter to William Faris were left a similar
sum, but with Hamilton as guardian and trustee.<br>
<br>
&quot;The remainder of his estate was to be divided among his children, Rawley,
Elvira, and Hamilton, and among the children of Martin, deceased. It was
explained in the will that Joseph had gotten his share in the payments on the
home allowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;The last time a Sivley's name was recorded on the deed books of this
county was in 1870.<br>
<br>
&quot;Among the present (1932) descendants are: from Joseph, Miss Lucy Landman
of Huntsville, Joseph Landman of Chicago, and George P. Landman of Chicago; from
Hamilton, Mrs. Moore, wife of a Memphis physician, and a Mrs. Fields of
Washington, D. C.<br>
<br>
&quot;Laura M Landman, who first was married to Robert Randall Kelty and later
to Thomas J. Young, both of Huntsville. Emma E. Landman, who was married to J.
F. Young and Arthur S. Landman, all are deceased grandchildren of Joseph.<br>
<br>
&quot;Joseph, the member of the family to last own the home, had five children.
They included Mary Frances, who was married to George P. Landman, former
prominent local cotton broker; Anna Rebecca, who was married to D. J. Jones;
Elvira J., who was married to Richard Halsey, all of Huntsville; Sarah Estelle,
who was married to J. R. Little, Raleigh, N. C., and Archie who died while
young.<br>
<br>
&quot;This home, today the property of W. F. Garth, is a poor monument to the
fineness which once lay about the winding stairway in its very heart. Mill
tenants and poor upkeep have carried it into a dilapidated state.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its cellar door stands open to the passing tramp, to the wandering animal
or food-seeking fowl. Trash is piled in all corners, while ashes from the last
tenant�s fires are heaped high upon its hearths. Windows devoid of panes,
allow the wind to whip the dirt about on its floors. Boards from crates now take
the place of the door of fine woodwork that once hung beneath the archway at the
front. Even the railing of the winding stairs has partly been carried away.
Chimneys at each end of the house are in good condition, but cracks follow the
four walls from the ground to the shingled roof now covered with tin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Outside, porches are gone and there are no signs that there ever was a
lawn. A plowed field runs up to its front doorstep. A few feet away a pit marks
the site of the icehouse where was stored ice from the pond below. The mill was
razed years ago, but the old frame house appears far sounder than the main
dwelling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Few persons are present visitors, from the standpoint of curiosity or
interest, at this home. Last February, there came to the estate an expensively
dressed woman in a fine car, driven by a chauffer in uniform. She was from
Chicago, she said, and the granddaughter of a Sivley. After looking the place
over and getting her bearings, she left.<br>
<br>
&quot;The next day, however, she appeared again, this time ordering her car up a
narrow winding road to the small family graveyard, surrounded by cedars some
half a mile from the house. Nearly two hours later she departed without coming
near the old home again.<br>
<br>
&quot;This visitor left her mark behind her. In the southwest corner of the
burial ground, 10 feet from a large gravestone and at the base of an immense
cedar tree, she had her chauffer dig. First, in order to do so, he cut away the
roots on that side of the tree, some of which measured six or eight inches in
diameter. Soon, he uncovered a brick vault, four feet square and two and
one-half feet deep, extending under the tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was taken from this vault, which certainly was not once a grave, is
not known. It may have been a fortune cached there by her forefathers, perhaps
during the Civil War. This wealth may have been in the form of gold, silver or
jewels. Again, it may have been valuable papers buried there so many years ago,
with a tree planted on top of it, that roots from the seedling, and even the
tree itself, have grown to a massive size.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever she found, this woman doubtless was one descendant of a historic
family who believed the cryptic message left for her on a map found in her
grandsire's strong box.&quot;<br>
