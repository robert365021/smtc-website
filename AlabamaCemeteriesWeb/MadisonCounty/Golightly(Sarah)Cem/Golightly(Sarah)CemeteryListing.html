<b>Inscription: SARAH GOLIGHTLY Departed this life Feb. 17, 1847. In the 40th year of her age.

<p><br>
The story goes that Sarah and Hugh could not get along. It is said there was 
alcohol involved at least on his part. So they agreed to be buried 5 miles apart. True 
to that legend is this monument along Shady Grove Road deep in the forest and her husbands monument in a well cared for cemetery about (yes) 5 miles away
in Golightly Cemetery. <br>
<br>
I was told by the home owner in front of this cemetery the monument is behind the home where Hugh &amp; Sarah Golightly lived at one time<br>
<br>
Sarah Golightly is also listed on the stone with her husband Hugh Golightly in the Golightly Cemetery several miles from this place inscribed as follows:
&quot;Sarah E. Wilson, wife of Hugh Golightly, died Feb 17, 1847.&quot;<br>
<br>
The monument says she died in the 40th year of her age. Hence 1847-40 = 1807, 
hardly precise. 
She could have been born as early as Feb 18, 1806 and still be forty on 17 Feb 1847. 
Chances are 83% she was born in 1806 because there were 10 
months of possibilities in 1806 and only 2 months in 1807. So to calculate the mathematical probability she was born in 1806, 
it is 10/12 or 83%.&nbsp; [Pop math quiz at 0100 hours. CWA]</p>
