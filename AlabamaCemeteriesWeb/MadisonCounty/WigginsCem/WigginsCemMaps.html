At the 
intersection of Interstate 65 &amp; Wall-Triana Highway go south until Wall Triana 
Highway junctions with Electronics Blvd. Turn left there and start around the 
circle until you reach the junction of Pentastar Dr SW. Turn right there and 
just before that road bends back south (right) look left out in the field at a 
round grove of trees and just inside the tree line is the cemetery.<br>
