****The box tomb of Brancy Davie may be the only one of its kind in this county; 
the sides, ends and lid were of quality lime. Her inscription was carved on one 
(south) side and a beautiful &amp; loving tribute from her husband was carved on the 
(north) other side. The lid (top) was a masterpiece. In the center of the lid 
was carved an ornate shield in bas-relief and in the center of the shield were 
carved these words: <i>I am not dead, but only sleeping.</i> </span></font>

Modified from what Dorothy Johnson said in 1978. Unfortunately for us the 
vandals crushed most of the beauty out of this tomb. Another issue is that a 
huge Beech tree is hovering over this stone. It is likely to drop giant limbs in 
the near future. It is in the latter stages of its life. I would be surprised if 
the top survives that onslaught.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
*** This stone has never before been reported.<br>
<br>
This cemetery was all but destroyed several months ago <font color="#CC3300">
[Dorothy Johnson, 1978]</font> by neighborhood boys bunting rabbits, according 
to a nearby resident. Cattle <font color="#CC3300">[Livestock no longer a 
threat, 2014]</font> have now been let into the graveyard and have about 
finished the destruction the irresponsible boys begun. I <font color="#CC3300">
[Dorothy] </font>spent several hours here<font color="#CC3300"> [so did I - C. 
Wayne Austin 28 Mar 2014 - trying to find what she did . We noticed the same 
broken &amp; missing parts. She found more inscriptions than I did due to the stones being in better shape 
then</font>] attempting to find missing parts to the pieces of tombstones, but 
was unsuccessful for the most part. <font color="#CC3300">[Dorothy found parts 
of inscriptions on two more tombs than I, but an additional stone turned up 
since she surveyed. From my perspective I could only see 5 
box tombs (cyrpts) and two upright stones or seven monuments, instead of her 9, 
but that is not final because stones fall and sink into the ground. Box tombs 
though, are just as hard to read, tumble all over the place, but they leave their 
footprint and are easily counted.][It is interesting that since 1978 
when she reassembled all the parts for a reading I had to dig the same ones from 
under the ground and&nbsp; move parts together some as heavy as 200 lbs to again 
read what is remaining of these tombs and all of that sinking into the ground 
and separation occurred naturally. [C
