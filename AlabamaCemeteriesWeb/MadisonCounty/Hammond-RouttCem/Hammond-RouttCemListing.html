Bettie that dark brown hair that lies so placid breathless round thy head and

For more information on the Hammond 
Family see Bouldin-Hammond Cemetery northwest of this place and also on this 
site. Dorothy Johnson in her book &quot;Madison County 
Alabama Cemeteries&quot; Vol 1 gave some indication that she had visited this cemetery which leads me 
to think it still exist in a nearby thicket somewhere. Eventually someone will 
find it again and offer it here or elsewhere as a photo cemetery survey. As of 
now this is the only publication of the cemetery aside from Dorothy's 
publication and there are no visual presentations anywhere.</b></p>
