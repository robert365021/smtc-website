This ACME Mapper Map 2.1 originally from Google Shows the GPS of
the Allison-Hewlett Cemetery. This is at GPS coordinates of N. 34.82673 W. -86.66789. <br>

&nbsp;From Huntsville go out Pulaski Pike to Bob Wade Lane and turn left. Go to 
Nich Fichard Road and the cemetery is shown on maps as out in the field in the 
NW junction of those road. I have not found this cemetery yet but examined o 
couple of the thickets only to find nothing. I will examine others in time. I am 
probably looking for large box tombs and maybe some small upright monuments. 
According to the listing there are about 3 to 4 tombstones.<br>

This is a view of the location as it is mapped on various mapping sites. A close 
look shows no sign of a cemetery. Now that leads me to look elsewhere including 
those thickets west of this point. Also there is a possibility the cemetery was 
dug up and moved to another cemetery but I question that because the soil from 
this GPS view shows no sign of being disturbed. I will make more attempts to 
locate this cemetery in the future when it dries out.<br>
