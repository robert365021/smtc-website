This aerial map shows the GPS of the Kincaid Cemetery. The location is 
indicated in the center of the map marked at GPS N 34.94974 X W -86.58941. 
Alternate Locator: Section 14, Township 1S, Range 1W, E/2 NE SE SE. On section 
line between Sections 13 and 14 In a clump of young trees. Now on the side of a 
subdividion lot. The owner who will allow you to visit here is on the south side 
of the cemetery and they are pleasant to deal with but deserve our usual respect 
for their privacy. They have assumed the care of this very old cemetery.<br>

From Huntsville go north on Hwy 231/431 to Charity Lane and turn west (left). Go 
about a mile and turn right on Hazel Trace into a subdivision. Follow that to 
Singletree Dr on your right and turn east (right) there. Go several hundred 
yards and when the road begins to bend left (northward) the home in the corner 
straight ahead is the property owner. Unless you get permission you will be 
unable to get past the chain link fence. <br>

This close up aerial view shows a red check highlighting the cemetery premises. 
There is a fence today with access from the property owners side, on the south. 
The cemetery is inside a thicket of Sassafras &amp; Hackberry trees.<br>
