<font color="#800000">Obituary for Mrs. Louisa C. Ward (1847-1893)<br>
<br>
Ward: Mrs. Louisa C. Ward (nee Hagewood) was born in Dickson County, Tennessee, 
December 16, 1847; was happily converted to God at the age of 12 or 14 years and 
soon thereafter connected herself with the church. She was married to Rev. D.W. 
Ward, of the North Alabama Conference, February 1, 1870 and died in the 
parsonage at New Market, November 24, 1893. While attending the last session of 
the North Alabama Conference Brother Ward was called home to the bedside of his 
dying wife. Although she had been a sufferer for a long time, her death was a 
great shock to her family. No one thought the end so near. But when it came it 
found her ready to meet the issue without a tremor or a doubt. She had been a 
true wife and a devoted mother, ever ready to minister to the comfort and 
happiness of husband and children. She had been reared in the lap of luxury, yet 
she was ready to share with her husband the hardships incident to an itinerant 
life. The legacy left her by her father was consumed supplementing short 
salaries and educating her children. Sometimes when the road seemed so very hard 
and the demands of a growing family pressed heavily upon Brother Ward and he 
would suggest that for the sake of wife and children he had better locate. 
Sister Ward would not consent, saying, &quot;we will go to our work and trust in the 
Lord to provide for our needs&quot;. And so for twenty<br>
three years she worked and sacrificed and trusted, ministering to the wants of 
her children and aiding her husband in his work.<br>
<br>
Sister Ward was not as demonstrative as some people, but she appreciated her 
friends and always had a way of showing it. She loved the church and was 
untiring in her efforts to advance its works. Her home and heart were always 
open to ministers of the gospel. But she is gone. No more will that voice be 
heard soothing the sorrows of the little children. But in the skies that voice 
has been blended with the angels and suited to their harps and shall sing 
forever the praises of God. May the hearts of husband and children be comforted 
in the fact that while the dark-winged messenger was entering that home, at the 
same time the white-robed spirits of the redeemed were there to take the freed 
spirit through the gates ajar for<br>
her.<br>
