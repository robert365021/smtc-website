I once ask a little ole lady sitting in her yard if the cemetery down the road 
was a black or white cemetery. She smiled and said &quot;Just Gods People&quot;.&nbsp; I 
smiled and agreed and went on my merry way. So this cemetery is &quot;just Gods 
people.&quot;<br>
<br>
<font size="2">Small cemeteries will either take one 
or two routes. They become a neighborhood cemetery and continue 
to grow and are maintained or they become abandoned after the last of the family dies out.&nbsp; 
If luck ensues the cemetery will fall into the hands of a landowner who respects 
it and continues to maintain it with the help of remaining family. If not, it will become abandoned and 
possibly be a thorn in the side of a land owner who may be naturally unkempt 
anyway. To him a cemetery on his property is largely just an annoyance getting 
in the way of his productive gainful use of land. It is that scenario where problems begin to unfold in the decline and destruction of a small family 
cemetery. The longer that a cemetery goes after the last burial the more likely 
it will become abandoned. I have noticed many cemeteries set prior to 1870 in dense 
thickets that have fallen into ruin.</font></p>
