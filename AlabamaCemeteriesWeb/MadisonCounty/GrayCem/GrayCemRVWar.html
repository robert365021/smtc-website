<br>
</font></b>Died in this county on the 15th instantly the 79th year of his age. He was 
born in Perth near Edinburg in Scotland, and in early life emigrated to the 
United States. When the struggle for human liberty commenced, he rallied beneath 
the standard of his adopted country, and served as a Private and Ensign in the 
regular service, under General Morgan. <br>
Upon the return of peace, he devoted himself to agricultural pursuits; and in 
the quiet favored mode of existence, discharged through a long life, all the 
social duties of a man and citizen. He was an affectionate husband, a fond 
parent, and an indulgent master, and was universally beloved, not only in the 
family circle but through the extended circle of his acquaintance. He was a 
professor of the religion of Jesus Christ for 58 years, and in his retired 
sphere included the sacred principles he practiced. <br>
Having disposed of his property and settled all his earthly concerns, he was 
frequently heard to observe that nothing remained to him but to die, and this 
last act of his life he performed with the calm and joyous serenity which the 
Christian alone can display. . . . . . . . . . . . </p>
