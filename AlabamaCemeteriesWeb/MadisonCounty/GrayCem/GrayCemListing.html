Base of a stone without the top present southern area of the cemetery. Could 
this be the James Anerton memorial?: <a href="IMG_3485.JPG">3485</a><br>
Grave marked only with two bricks, one at the head, and one at the foot of the 
grave (north of the Sisco graves).

Three graves covered with the piles of stones probably at one time these were 
stacked in orderly fashion. <a href="IMG_3446.JPG">3446</a>/<a href="IMG_3447.JPG">3447</a>/<a href="IMG_3448.JPG">3448</a>/<a href="IMG_3449.JPG">3449</a><br>
Several Graves in the Gray family area with heaped up mounds of brick, around 
the Eleanor Gray tomb. These are very old. (Hard to see here because depth does 
not show up well in photos) <a href="IMG_3454.JPG">3454</a>/<a href="IMG_3455.JPG">3455</a>/<a href="IMG_3456.JPG">3456</a>/<a href="IMG_3457.JPG">3457</a>/<a href="IMG_3458.JPG">3458</a>/<a href="IMG_3459.JPG">3459</a>/<a href="IMG_3460.JPG">3460</a>/<a href="IMG_3461.JPG">3461</a>/<a href="IMG_3462.JPG">3462</a>/<a href="IMG_3463.JPG">3463</a>/<a href="IMG_3464.JPG">3464</a>/<a href="IMG_3465.JPG">3465</a>/<a href="IMG_3466.JPG">3466</a>/<a href="IMG_3467.JPG">3467</a>/<a href="IMG_3468.JPG">3468</a>/This 
grave is further west than the others - out of the Gray family area:<a href="IMG_3475.JPG">3475</a><br>
There are about 25 to 50 grave sinks that are there because wooden caskets were 
utilized which decayed and as the wood disappeared the grave sunk in to fill the 
void. I did not try to photograph them because they do not show up on the 
photos.<br>
fieldstones marking graves in the far southern area of the cemetery. Could this 
be the Betts (black) cemetery. <a href="IMG_3476.JPG">3476</a>/<a href="IMG_3477.JPG">3477</a>/<a href="IMG_3478.JPG">3478</a>/<a href="IMG_3479.JPG">3479</a>/<a href="IMG_3480.JPG">3480</a>/<a href="IMG_3481.JPG">3481</a>/<a href="IMG_3482.JPG">3482</a>/<a href="IMG_3483.JPG">3483</a>/<a href="IMG_3484.JPG">3484</a><br>

<p><font size="2" color="#4A2500"><b><i>**Note: The graves of Eleanor, William 
and Joseph Gray were together and covered with brick. At the head of each of 
these brick covered graves is a sandstone marker. The inscriptions on Joseph's 
and William's headstones have all but eroded away, but Eleanor's is in better 
condition. When facing these headstones, Eleanor's is on the left, William's in 
the center and Joseph's on the right. It will be only a short time before all 
identification will have weathered off these stones and then it will be 
impossible to tell who is in which grave. [Dorothy Scott Johnson about 1970.] 
Who am I to question Dorothy. Anything can happen between 1970 and 2014. 
I could not confirm this with what I found. Eleanor Gray's marker may have been 
moved since 1970 explaining the difference. There seems to be 4 graves (piled up brick) lined up in a 
row north/south where Eleanor's tombstone was found and hers is now on the south 
end of that row of graves. What Dorothy says makes sense assuming Joseph was a 
child of Eleanor &amp; William Gray though.<br>
</i></b><i><b><br>
Photographed this cemetery from the north to the south. 
At this juncture with the fresh leaves fallen, I could not located any new stones 
except perhaps the marked fieldstone of D.R. Hansen not shown on findagrave.com 
This is an old church yard cemetery for the members and I am sure the Betts 
Cemetery was the starting burial ground for the black slaves which became 
freedmen after 1865, but likely they continued to use this cemetery for burial, 
especially since this area was predominantly black for many years after 1865, 
though that is changing, because of normal upward mobility, and 
commercial growth.</b></i></font></p>
<p><i><b><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">This cemetery is shown on TVA 
quadrangle and local county maps as the &quot;Betts&quot; Cemetery but that is incorrect. 
This cemetery covers several acres and marked and unmarked graves are spread all 
over the acreage. Dorothy Johnson says she dug several markers out of many 
years' accumulation of leaves and dirt and couldn't help but wonder how many 
more she couldn't locate. This cemetery is unique in Madison County because of 
its many brick covered graves. We/she counted 11 brick covered graves, several 
stone-covered graves and one very large brick wall enclosing several more graves 
which didn't have markers. The bricks were hand-made, probably by slave labor, 
and the top layer of brick on the wall had been glazed. It must have been a 
beautiful wall at one time.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This was originally the graveyard of the Providence Church which was located on 
the hill above. The church building has been gone many years. <br>
<br>
Above (east of) this cemetery are graves of the (black) Betts family but there 
are&nbsp; no markers there to show the spot. Dorothy Scott Johnson about 1970.</b></font></i></p>
