The Robert Clark stone could not at 
first be located. After the footstone was found a probe was used to locate the 
headstone under the ground about 3 inches. It was of course found to the west of 
the footstone. The headstone was found broken in half, but the two parts were 
set up and photographed by propping the top up with a cut stick. The base half 
of the two broken parts was installed into the ground so it would stand and the 
top was laid against the base to reinforce the standing position of the base, 
see photo #6329.</p>
