At the 
intersection of Hwy 231 &amp; Winchester Road go north about 5 miles and turn west 
(left) on Monroe Road and go about 2 miles and look left at a tree lined fence 
row spanning north/south as shown on the aerial view below. Follow the fence row 
100 Yards south on a field road and stop and go directly east into and across 
the fence row and then across a short opening and the cemetery is in that round 
shaped tree grove to the east of you. You will see the two stones, one standing, 
and the Robert Clark Stone broken but half of it is standing.<br>

This zoomed in map with a red check shows where the cemetery can be found in 
this thicket which appears to be one big woodland but in fact the cemetery is 
separate little round thicket.<br>
