This topographical map shows the GPS of the Massengale/Sisco Graves. The location is 
indicated in the center of the map marked at GPS N 34.873435 X W -86.39832. 
Specific Location: Section 15-2-2E N/2 NW NE across Hurricane Road southwest 
from Cedar Grove Church in clump of trees in a field between two houses. The 
cemetery is divided across two properties with a fence row in the middle.<br>

From Huntsville go northeast on Winchester Rd to New Market and turn right on 
Hurricane Road. Go past the junction to Upper Hurricane Rd and continue south 
for another 1 1/2 miles. The road bends in a wide circle as you travel that last 
1.5 miles. Then look left at the thicket between two nearby houses with some 
out-buildings behind the cemetery. The property line of those two properties is 
split in the center of this cemetery. Permission will be required from both 
owners to visit all the graves as the Mahala Massengale headstone sits on the 
western side of the divide in the property.</b></font>
