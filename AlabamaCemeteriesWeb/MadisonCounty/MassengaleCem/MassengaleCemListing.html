(Mahala Massengale's upright tombstone was broken by the pressure up against it from an old 
tree before it decayed. Her stone was lying face down when I found it.)

<font size="2">At the foot of Mahala's grave is an adult's grave marked only with two unlettered 
fieldstones. One is the headstone (west) and the other the footstone (east).&nbsp; <a href="IMG_0946.JPG">0946</a><br>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the &quot;S's&quot; were reversed on the Sisco and the Massengale stones 
indicating the same tombstone inscriber did both stones. <br>
<br>
There were many unmarked graves, in this nearly quarter acre plot. The Mahala 
Massengale stone is now divided across two property lines of two neighbors. 
Maybe the original line was moved at one time to the east into the near center of 
Mahala's 
grave after a survey.<br>
