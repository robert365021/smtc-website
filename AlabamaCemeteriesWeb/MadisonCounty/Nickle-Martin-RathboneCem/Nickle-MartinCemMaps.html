This Aerial map shows the GPS of
the Nickle-Martin-Rathbone Cemetery. The GPS calculates to N 34.74215 X W -86.62625 
approximating the center of the cemetery.<br>

At the 
intersection of University Dr NW and Jordan Lane (Hwy 53) go north about 3/10 of 
a mile and turn right (east) on McDow Ave NW. Follow that a few hundred yards to 
Retlaw St. and turn left turn (north). Go to the end of that and turn left 
(west) on Rees Ave. and park at the end and walk between the fences provided (I 
think) for you to get to the cemetery about 50 yards north of you. The cemetery 
is under the trees and is likely being maintained as a part of someone's 
(thanks) back yard, but maybe the city is maintaining it. <br>

The inside of the yellow outlined image approximates the area where you will 
find graves. In no way does this attempt to outline the legal boundaries of the 
cemetery. Likewise I do not know if there is a survey anywhere of this cemetery.<br>
