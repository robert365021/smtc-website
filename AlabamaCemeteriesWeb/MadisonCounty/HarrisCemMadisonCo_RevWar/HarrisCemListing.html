1853 published the following, in part:<br>
<br>
&quot;Died, in Madison County, Ala. , Jan. 23rd, 1853, Capt. Richard Harris. The 
deceased was born in Powhatan Co., Va.,
on the 20th of November, 1758. When but a youth, at the age of 17, he entered the 
army, and with that veteran band of
soldiers, fighting for liberty and truth, devoted himself to his country's 
interests till the close of the war. He was an eye-witness of the surrender of 
Lord Cornwallis at Little York. After having 
shared with his countrymen the hardships of
war, he returned to his home and friends to enjoy that glorious boon, liberty, 
for which he had so earnestly contended. <br>
He professed religion in Powhatan Co. , Va., and soon after united himself with 
the M. E. Church, where he remained, for
more than half a century He removed from Virginia to Madison County, Ala., in 
1809 and resided near Blue Spring till the
day of his death.....&quot;</b><br>
