	This cemetery had a chain link fence installed at one time. I believe farm 
	machinery ran across the south side of the cemetery destroying the fence and 
	plundering the stones. The only two unbroken stones are that of William 
	&amp; Sarah Freeman. However sadly&nbsp; they are wedged under a fast growing 
	hackberry tree that is keeping them pinned against the ground. It is 
	now impossible to remove these two stones without cutting the tree. This tree 
	will eventually crush both stones under its weight if allowed to continue to 
	grow. </font></p>
