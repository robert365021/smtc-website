<p><span style="background-color: #CCFFFF">This 
cemetery plot is quite large, well kept and sparsely spotted with 
a couple of known graves.&nbsp; This cemetery is hardly used anymore by the 
black community. They largely use the New Triana Cemetery closer to the center 
of town near the river.<br>
<br>
The town of Triana was incorporated on November 13, 1819 and the city father 
were: Henry Chambers, Waddy Tate, William Adair, John T. Lindsay and Thomas 
Bibb. Oddly history associates these names more closely with Huntsville than Triana. 
The slaves came as that opportunity for cotton as a farm product 
exploded.<br>
<br>
Triana is situated on the banks of the Tennessee River and was established as a 
port from which to ship the cotton produced by the fruitful plantations nearby. 
These were labor intensive and required lots of help both slave and workers of 
other nature.<br>
<br>
When the railroad went through the area the planters started shipping their 
cotton by rail and the need for a port vanished. The bottom dropped out of the 
price of cotton in the 1840's and ruined many large planters. After the Civil 
War labor to work the fields became a problem and the town of Triana died. The 
town is now predominately black as is the general farming region. Graveyards in 
the area follow the path of - (1) old ones pre-civil war being white (2) after 
the civil war, black, up to current times. Some slave owners when they died 
freed their slaves and willed 
their land to them generally if they had no heirs.</span></p>
