Beneath this marble slab rest the remains of JOHN HUTCHINGS, (who) died on the 
20th day of Nov. 1817, Aged 42 years. Death is but the dawn of life immortal. 
Restored 8/27/1970 by Madison Co. Commission.**<br>
</b></i><b><br>
** A Concrete slab is at the 
front of the John Hutchings tomb inscribed as: &quot;Restored 8/27/1970 by Madison Co. 
Commission&quot;. Wonder 
of any of those commissioners are still with us today.</b></p>
<p><b>There is damage to this tomb top that appears to be from a high powered rifle 
bullet. It did not damage much of the inscription but left some gouges. Imagine 
what the 1970 Madison Co. Commission would have done to the rascal firing those 
shots. However it is possible that damage came from musket balls during the 
Civil War.</b></p>
<p><b>Historical Records were 
recorded showing evidence 
of other graves here but no markers. Also a &quot;mourners bench&quot; is near this tomb. 
It was added by the Madison Co Commission restoration in 1970.<br>
John was living here in the Mississippi Territory when he died in 1817.<br>
<br>
These censuses of Surry 
NC while probably from the same family do not seem to contain John in them since 
in 1800 he would have been about 25 and in 1820 he was deceased. John may have 
been here illegally since this was Indian Land therefore no census record.<br>
