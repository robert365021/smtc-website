At the 
intersection of Highway 72 go north on Moores Mill Road. Cross Winchester Road 
and the road bends to the right and becomes Darwin Road. That terminates into 
Macon Lane. Turn left there and go 400 yards to Rube Robinson Road on the right. 
Follow that until it turns into Stone Cemetery Road. When the gravel road bends 
to the right go another 150 yards and park your vehicle and walk up the slight 
slope into the woods and find the memorial stones about the center of the 
woodland at the top of the slope.<br>

Notice the labeling under the tree line. This marker may be a bit south of the 
actual location. This cemetery needs care as the small trees growing up around 
the stones under the big trees will become large trees before long and begin to 
threaten the stones.<br>
