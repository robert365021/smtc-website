Pets in this cemetery:<br>
In the NE corner of this family plot are three small grave stones marked as 
follow. These are all dogs I think: <br>
Puss Irvine, <i>1952, A faithful dog </i><a href="IMG_3409.JPG">3409</a>
<br>

<p>Obviously I don't have a say in a private 
family cemetery as long as the Matlock are making the decision, but I don't recommend burial of pets in a cemetery because 
of the confusion it may cause later when this graveyard may become abandoned and 
torn up from livestock and or trees smashing down on the stones. Fragments of 
stones will then co-mingle causing such a mass of confusion that who knows what 
the information will falsely depict. A better option is to get together with 
other pet lovers and establish a pet cemetery somewhere. Small cemeteries will either take one 
or two routes. They become a neighborhood cemetery and continue 
to grow and are maintained or they become abandoned after the last of the family dies out.&nbsp; 
If luck ensues the cemetery will fall into the hands of a landowner who respects 
it as a cemetery and continues to maintain it. If not it will be abandoned and 
become a thorn in the side of a land owner who is naturally unkempt 
anyway. To him a cemetery on his property is largely just an annoyance getting 
in the way of his productive gainful use of land. It is that scenario that problems begin to unfold in the decline and destruction of a small family 
cemetery. The longer that a cemetery goes after the last burial the more likely 
it will become abandoned.</p>
