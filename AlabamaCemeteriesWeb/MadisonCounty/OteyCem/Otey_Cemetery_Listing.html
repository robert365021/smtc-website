*Walter and Mary Walton Otey brought their young family to Madison County in 
1817. They cleared the land and built a two-room cabin that was to later be 
replaced by the mansion <br>
that now stands a few yards in front of the small, walled cemetery. After 
Walter's death in 1823 Mary carried on the affairs of the plantation.<br>
<br>
**During Reconstruction Octavio Aurelio Otey contributed whistles, robes, and other 
items to the
local KKK. Legend has it, one night many white-robed Klansmen silently 
surrounded
her home and asked if they could do anything for her, but she answered in the 
negative. Later
that night a man was taken from his home and whipped for beating his wife. This 
somewhat confirms of the original purpose of the KKK as an organization to 
protect the former confederate families from persecution, but as time progressed 
they obviously evolved.<br>
<br>
***Not related to the Otey family. The Talialerro 
family was
travelling when the child became ill. The family stopped at the Otey home to rest 
until the child
recovered or became well enough to continue the journey. The child died and was 
buried in
Otey cemetery. The Taliaferros' are listed in the 1830 census as having 18 slaves, 
but no
children.<br>
