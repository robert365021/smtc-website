From Huntsville go northeast on Winchester Rd to New Market and turn left on 
Moores Mill Road. Follow that for several miles passing the bend to the right of 
the road. Go to Ruth Circle on your left and turn in. You will ind the cemetery 
on the right side of that road immediately after turning right. It is about 100 
yards up the slope behind a trailer home in a stand of trees. Mr Pearce owns all 
the land surrounding the cemetery and makes some attempt to keep it clear. He 
lives nearby across Moores Mill Road.<br>
