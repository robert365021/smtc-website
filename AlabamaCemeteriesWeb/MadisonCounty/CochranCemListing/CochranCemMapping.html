This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Cochran Cemetery of Madison Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map. GPS: N 34.90460 X W 86.42332. Since this is a large sprawling 
cemetery the GPS is in the center near the entrance.<br>

At the 
intersection of Winchester Highway and Hwy 231 North go east to northeast out 
Winchester Hwy to New Market. Turn right or east on Hurricane Road inside New 
Market (only major eastern road out of New Market) to Davis Street and next 
turn south or right on Davis street and merge onto Cemetery Rd. Just after that look to your left at 
the stones and the entrance way to the cemetery. The cemetery fronts Cemetery Street and sprawls 
eastward &amp; then back to the north.<br>

Notice the entrance road here. Only a small part of the cemetery can be seen 
due to the trees being leafed out.<br>
