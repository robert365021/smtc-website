This cemetery was found in the midst of 
civilization, but has been ignored for generations by the uncivilized, that 
abuse &amp; neglect it. No one claims its maintenance. What a shame. What majestic 
beauty it once had. It had brush growing profusely among its massive, but now 
broken tombs. I cut some of the smaller bushes to get close enough to make these 
photos. Please someone nearby adopt this little cemetery and repair it by 
restacking the stones. The bases are level and most of the tops will stack back 
on their bases cleanly without anything except some heavy lifting equipment. 
Even the broken parts will stack neatly without even gluing them together. Next 
plant a (Leland Cypress) hedge to shield the cemetery from the dangerous vandals 
around. The nearby neighbor(s) may then be interested in mowing the small 
premises to keep the brush from creating a bad view of their property. Write me 
if you wish to tackle this and I will give free advice and volunteer to help 
assuming my health is still well enough for that. &lt;WayneAL1@aol.com&gt; 20 Nov 
2014. I believe the land surrounding this cemetery belongs to the folks due 
south of this cemetery and not the new home owner who recently built here.</b></p>
