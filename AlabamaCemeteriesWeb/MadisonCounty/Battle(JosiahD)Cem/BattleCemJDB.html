The Huntsville Weekly Democrat, 10 May 1882<br>
In Memoriam<br>
With feelings of no ordinary sorrow, we chronicle the death of our esteemed 
friend and former room-mate, while at college, J. D. BATTLE, who died at Dr. 
HAMPTON�s, his brother-in-law�s, Saturday night, May 29, 1882 (sic - see below). 
Deceased had been in bad health for several years; though, toward the last, his 
sufferings were intense, he bore them with great fortitude. Just as his noble 
life was budding into that of useful manhood, he was taken from the walks of 
men. Though he made no public profession of religion, from his conduct and 
conversation we feel satisfied that such a pure, stainless soul has been 
summoned from this mode of existence to enjoy the sweets of a brighter and more 
glorious abode. Pure and high-minded in his own life, he could not tolerate 
anything mean or degrading in others. Having been deprived of a mother�s care 
and training in early life, he found in his sister, not only a maternal love, 
but the affections of mother and sister beautifully combined. Being devoted to 
her, he ever regarded her counsel with brotherly tenderness. While at school and 
through his course at college, he was highly esteemed by all who knew him best. 
Being a close student and having a bright, clear mind, his recitations were 
every concise and accurate, giving him a standing at college surpassed by but 
few. After his graduation in 1877, at our State University, he attended the 
Infirmary at Baltimore, Md., where he took one course in Dentistry, but bad 
health prevented the completion of his course. While there he displayed a 
decided talent for his chosen profession. The funeral services were conducted by 
Rev. W. F. Kone, whose remarks were solemnly impressive and consoling. After the 
interment, we found mournful pleasure in seeing the grave beautifully decorated, 
with the fairest of Spring floral offerings, by the young ladies, friends of 
deceased. Thus he lived and died. Requiescat in pace!<br>
