This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Vasser-Pettus Cemetery of Madison Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map marked by the Cem. <br>
Location:</font></b> Section 
7-3S-2W. N/2 N/2 NE NE. Approx. 3 mi. southwest of Jeff, Ala.<b><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">
Behind houses along Pine Grove Road where that road spans northward toward Nick 
Davis Road. This little cemetery is completely surrounded by modern subdivisions 
and has no access and is largely abandoned and cutoff from civilization, in 
spite of the fact that the last burial was in my life time.<br>

At the 
intersection of Capshaw Road and Sam Thomas Road go north on Sam Thomas Road to 
Mossy Branch Drive. Turn right and follow that around until it terminates into 
Horse Pin Place. At Horse Pin place Rd you are faced with a task of crossing 
someone's private yard to get into the large field behind the houses where the 
cemetery is located. I chose to go to the drainage ditch marked by my yellow 
pointer, because it is likely public. I went into and followed the ditch between two houses until 
it bumped into the fence. After crossing the fence, without damaging it, I walked 
across the field west toward the cemetery to the edge of the woods and into the 
woods as indicated by the yellow highlighted path. That is about a 500 yard walk and a 
fence crossing which could leave the novice out, so if you do this be careful.<br>

Notice the yellow highlighted path indicating the path I took to the cemetery. 
The cemetery is in the center of the triangular area which juts east out of the forest 
covered area. The brown area in the open 
field is a garden so do not trample or disturb that area, nor the grape vines. 
One of the two houses fronting Pine Grove Road is where the land owner probably 
resides. I chose to follow the yellow highlighted 
area across the field because it seemed to be the best walking area which would not  
disturb any of the neighbors who may be alarmed at a stranger crossing the field 
behind their house. The storms of 2011 caused large trees to fall across the 
tombstones knocking them down and no one bothered to cut them up. I picked up 
several stones and put them back on their bases and tried to clear the area as 
best as I could with just a pair of lopping shears, but I was out manned and 
without proper equipment. <br>

I drew a triangle around the area fenced for the cemetery. The stones are 
right in the center and not near the edges. The white marks indicate about the 
pattern of the stones but not the count.<br>
