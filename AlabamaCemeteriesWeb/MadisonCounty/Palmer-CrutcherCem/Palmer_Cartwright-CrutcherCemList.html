cemetery. Looks as if it were put there recently -
perhaps within the last 50 years. Its disposition may or may not affect the
history of this graveyard, but some of the stones may have marked graves at one 
time, because their surface looks old. <a href="5955.JPG">5955</a> <br>

**Martha A., (1817-1884) wife of H. B. Cartwright, is buried in the old section 
of Madison City Cemetery. Also next to the grave of H. B. Cartwright is a grave 
which is <br>
much older than any with stones. It was a rock tomb which had crumbled and the 
rocks were strewn about the ground. There was no identification on it.<br>
The Cartwright family was the first to settle in this area of the county. 
(Dorothy Scott Johnson about 1989)<br>
</b></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
This graveyard is an oasis of neglect surrounded by wealth. Some of the graves/monuments are very near the 
road bank and in danger of sliding off into the ditch. Some 
fieldstones or box tomb base stones have already fallen into the ditch. The only 
standing stone is that for H.B. Cartwright and it is in danger falling over the 
bank from being there on the 
bank of Palmer Road.<br>
