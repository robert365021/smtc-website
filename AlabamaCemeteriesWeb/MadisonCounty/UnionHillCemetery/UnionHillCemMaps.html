This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Union Hill Cemetery. This is at GPS coordinates of N 34.79333 W -86.58369.<br>
<img border="0" src="UnionHillCemMap1.jpg"><br>
&nbsp;At the 
intersection of Hwy 431/231 go West on Winchester Rd. about 1/3 of a mile and 
look to your right at the Church Building. The cemetery is in the lot just past 
the Church building, but has nothing to do with the Cemetery. This is an old 
Pioneer Cemetery. It sits between the Home and Church.<br>

This close up view of the Clump of trees whereby the cemetery resides. Vandals 
have been picking away at this cemetery for years and while some of the 
tombstones are standing they appear to be out of place or misplaced and broken 
up.<br>
