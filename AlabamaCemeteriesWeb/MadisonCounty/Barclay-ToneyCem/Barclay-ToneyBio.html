Cyrus Samuel Aikin, a son of Robert and Esther [n�e Gaston] Aikin, was born in 
the bounds of Chester County, South Carolina in 1806. Around 1817, his family 
emigrated to the area around Huntsville, Alabama. Here Cyrus and his older 
brother, William started a business, manufacturing cotton gins, called W.A. &amp; 
C.S. Aikins Company.<br>
<br>
On April 3rd 1833, Cyrus married Miss Mildred Spicer Noble, a daughter of George 
and Elizabeth [n�e Spicer] Noble and sister of his brother William's wife, 
Elizabeth. Milly, as Mildred was known grew-up near Huntsville in Madison 
County, Alabama. No known children were born to this union.<br>
<br>
In 1836, Cyrus S. Aikin opened an independent firm with other partners in 
Columbus (MS), at the eastern border of Mississippi, responding to the westward 
movement. Cyrus Aikin was a manufacturer, a merchant and land spectacular. He 
moved frequently... living in Huntsville, Columbus, Mississippi and finally in 
Paducah, Kentucky. By the time of his death on January 10th 1842, Cyrus Aikin 
was nearly bankrupt. When his remains were returned to his wife back in 
Huntsville, all she received was his watch, a few papers and a buggy with horse.<br>
<br>
Cyrus Samuel Aikin was laid to rest in Barclay-Toney Cemetery; a cemetery of his 
sister-in-law, Mrs. Harris (Clarissa Noble) Toney's family.<br>
