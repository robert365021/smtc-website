At the intersection of Highway 72 and Old Rail Road Bed Road travel north 
several miles and go past Highway 53 (Ardmore Hwy). From Hwy 53 go slightly less 
than a mile and turn right on Toney Road. Travel about 1/2 mile and the cemetery 
can be seen on the north side of the road in a grove of trees out in the field 
along an old fence row. Since this is private land get permission as no 
trespassing signs are all around.<br>

Notice the yellow pointer indicating the trees where this small cemetery can 
be found. This cemetery is in extreme danger of being destroyed by the elements 
of neglect. The only stones standing are leaning badly and close to falling. 
Brush is very thick as no clearing has occurred here in a hundred years.&nbsp;A 
phone discussion with the land owner indicates he is interested in this cemetery 
and wants it cared for as best as can be done given the stones are old and 
fragile.<br>
If you wish to visit this cemetery please Contact Ricky Ennis for permission, 
but it is not advisable to visit here during the crop season.<br>
