This Aerial map shows the GPS of
the Hammond-Edwards Cemetery of Madison Alabama. GPS is North 34.81596 X West 
-86.75558. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map with the yellow cross not the green image to the right which 
is Googles incorrect location marking. <br>

Direction:
At the 
intersection of Highway 72 and Old Rail Road Bed Road travel north about 3+ 
miles and turn right on Orville Smith Road. Follow Orville Smith road east for 
more than one mile and that bends back south (right). Just after the right bend 
turn left (east) into the field (with permission) and into the TVA transmission 
lines clearing. Follow east along the (south) or right side of the Tree line 
going parallel with the transmission lines. Go 20 yards past the 2nd (smaller 
dual set of) transmission poles (the larger ones are on your right side of the 
small ones) stop and park your (hopefully all Terrain) vehicle and face (left (due north) looking into the woodland. Walk due north 100 yards into the woodland and 
you will find the small cemetery with four stones showing under what is now an 
old dead cedar thicket, but now immersed deep into the woodland. This is about 30 
feet before you come out into the yards of the neighbors who live along the 
south side of Silver Poplar Place. Stay back into the woodland so as not to 
disturb them. None of them have anything to do with ownership of this cemetery.<br>
