<i>This small cemetery is found deep 
into the woods between Orville Smith Road and Wall Triana Highway in a long 
stretch of Woodland that parallels TVA transmissions lines. It has been 
abandoned many years and is found only on Google maps, but placed there in the 
wrong location. It is a small Cemetery whereby no one even knows where it is. 
Nearby African American neighbors who may descended from these folks lying here 
did not know of its existence and for that matter seemed not to care to me. I am 
surprised it has not been bulldozed by unthinking folks. The first step in the 
destruction of old abandoned cemeteries is losing their location from public 
knowledge. Then comes the bulldozers, vandals and ugly things of nature that 
happen to graveyards. Often times these guys and their bulldozers are not even 
aware of the cemetery presence.<br>
This is known as the Hammond Cemetery on maps so I renamed it the Hammond-Edwards Cemetery 
to reflect another designation in the naming process. This is to clarify that there are several 
Hammond Cemeteries already in Madison County. I added it to Findagrave.com and 
gave it the name there of Hammond Cemetery of Orville Smith and added Eveline 
Edwards. <br>
There are very old Cedars that are long since dead that sprang up at one time 
around these stones. These served to beautify this premise at the time for 
relatives who kept this space as a serene place to visit. A place 
memorialized by the sadness of their loss. Now they too have joined their kin 
awaiting the 2nd coming of Christ and more time has posted this place as an abandoned 
relic of the past. Folks we should respect these places of burial in spite of our 
inability to connect with them as our ancestors.</i></b></p>
