This Aerial map shows the GPS of
the Mitchell Cemetery. Go here looking for only one lost memorial and other 
fieldstones probably marking the graves of John W. Mitchell, his parents and 
perhaps other siblings. The GPS calculates to N 34.85780 X W -86.61562.<br>

At the 
intersection of Monroe Road and Hwy 231/431 go west about two miles and look to 
your left (south) out into a field at a tree lined thicket where 
this cemetery is located.<br>
Alternate Location: Section 22-Township 2 South-Range 1 West, N/2 N/2 N/2. On 
Monroe Road, 1/2 mile north and 2-1/2 miles west of Meridianville, Alabama.<br>

Yellow labels in the center of the map marking the exact location of the rocks 
shown in the photos 
to be investigated by someone for their historical value as grave markers for 
the Mitchell family. This is private property so 
notification of the owners is necessary. You should also be aware of this large 
thicket being the home site for the Mitchell family including a barn location 
none of which is there anymore.<br>
