<p><b><u>1970 Commentary<br>
</u>This solitary stone is outside what was once the yard of an old home. The 
house has burned but the barn (not there in 2014)is still standing in 1970. On a 
visit to this grave in October, 1970, we discovered that someone had recently 
pulled the stone out of the ground and it was lying flat on the ground. Such a 
disrespectful act is inexcusable 1970. [D.J., 1978]<br>
<u><br>
Updated comment 5 Nov 2012:<br>
</u>At the time I visited this cemetery I did not see any clearly marked stones, 
but instead from the photos I see a possibility of one of the stones in view 
having an inscription. It is clearly a broken base. At my visit these were covered by a 
decaying Cedar tree and the limbs 
are sharp and need to be removed to further investigate this site, therefore I 
cannot conclusively say this is the actual grave of John W. Mitchell. It is in 
the right place though. [C. Wayne Austin 2014]<br>

<i>Story by Dorothy 
Johnson:<br>
<br>
Local folk lore relates that John W. Mitchell died under mysterious 
circumstances and the authorities wished to perform an autopsy to determine the 
cause of death. The father, Obediah, refused to allow the autopsy, but he was 
afraid they would exhume the body and perform it anyway. Thus the old gentleman 
buried his son so the grave could be seen from his bedroom window. He then 
rigged a shotgun aimed toward the grave so it would be handy in case his fears 
proved right.<br>
