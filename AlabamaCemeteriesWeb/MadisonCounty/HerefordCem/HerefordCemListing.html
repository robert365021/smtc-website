	<b>The two Powell graves were enclosed by a wrought iron fence within the 
cemetery. </b> 
	*<b>I have an ancestor Francis 
Epps b. 1799 Va. who was a male. For ladies this given name is traditionally 
spelled Frances with the &quot;e&quot;. The Frances Powell here either had a maiden name 
of Epps and she married a Harris prior to her marriage to Leven Powell or she 
had the maiden surname Harris indicating she was probably one of the daughters 
the many Harris ancestors around the Howell community of Lincoln County. Her 
mother was perhaps a daughter of an earlier Francis Epps b. abt 1770 or so. 
The name Eppes is inserted after the Francis and before the &quot;A&quot; suggesting this 
is not a surname. <br>
Those Francis Epps' of old were named after each other for several generations 
and various branches of the Epps family including the son-in-law of Thomas 
Jefferson our country's founder. This continued to be so for at least  
three generations in Lincoln County Tennessee. This naming trait was true of the 
Epps even for those whom I cannot prove to be the descendents of Thomas 
Jefferson. Best I can tell the line of Francis Wayland Eppes who was Thomas's 
son-in-law moved off to Florida and died there, probably leaving more Francis Eppes to be sorted out by those of us thirsty to be connected to our country's 
grand founding father Thomas Jefferson. They spelled the name Eppes as on the 
tombstone above. [CWA 8 Apr 2014]</b></p>
<p><b>I am told this was the 
Hereford Plantation at one time so there must be a slave graveyard here 
somewhere even though there may not be formal headstones.</b></p>
