<p>The west section of the Liberty Hill Cemetery is in 
bad shape with several monuments missing the top and thus the inscription. In 
other cases tops or parts of tops were found but could not easily be connected 
to the broken bases. Needs further work and some of the puzzle parts can be 
reassembled. From Dorothy Johnson's record of this cemetery we are 
missing monuments for Lucinda W. Hereford, Lucy A.S. Hereford, Mary A. Johnson, 
George H. Johnson, Enema May Johnson, Lena E. Scott, Mary C. Steel, Lucy J. 
Strong, but we found a couple more stones than she did that someone probably dug 
from the ground since her visit.<br>
<br>
I did some restoration work by digging out the stones that were sinking into the 
grounds and including this survey know some more parts that can be reassembled. 
Also it is clear the lawnmowers are a factor in damaging the cemetery by running 
constantly over the partially buried stones here. More needs to be done to get 
the stones out of the way of the mowers before the workers crush them and also 
get the stones above the ground so they dry more quickly after rains.</p>
