These initials were on a broken piece of stone which may have been a foot 
marker: J.L.P.<br>
<br>
I have visited this cemetery and took action in an attempt a clear the brush. At 
first I could only locate a couple or three readable markers, but attributed 
that to the density of the brush. The more I cleared the more I realized there 
was a very real problem with destruction of the grave assets. I am now of the 
opinion that we should thank Dorthy Scott Johnson for preserving the records of 
this graveyard in her book because any kind of a restoration would be next to impossible. 
Because of that I did not photograph the cemetery. but will do so when I can 
salvage what I think to be about 5 or six more inscriptions by turning over 
large broken box tombstone tops and assembling more fragments. That will then 
include only about 25% of the known grave listings in this cemetery. The rest 
are destroyed or have been lost as crushed fragments beneath the ground and 
could be salvageable in some degree depending on the effort applied to find them 
and reassemble them. <br>
Well maybe no further effort is better. The best approach probably is to accept the records as we have them today as 
being as complete as possible and proceed to collect a neighborhood fund to add 
an on site bronze plaque with these listings and return the original site to the 
birds, rabbits, cedar &amp; Privy Hedge thicket. [C. Wayne Austin, 20 Apr
