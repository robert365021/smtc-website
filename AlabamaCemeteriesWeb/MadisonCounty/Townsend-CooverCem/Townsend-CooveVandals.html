TOWNSEND-COOVER 
CEMETERY, (Hwy 231, Hazelgreen, Madison, Al.), MADISON COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>
<img border="0" src="Townsend-Coover-AerialMap.JPG" width="1600" height="639"><br>
Here we see a MS Bing image of the cemetery in a plowed field. There does 
not appear to be any major damage to the cemetery when this map was made back 
about three years ago. <br>
<img border="0" src="Townsend-Coover-AerialMap2.JPG" width="505" height="331"><br>
This is a Google version of the above map - made in the early spring and still the 
stones are about all standing. <br>
<img border="0" src="Vandalized-Ananatomy.jpg" width="1115" height="860"><br>
This is a blow up of the above MS Bing map showing the stones and the damage from the 
vandalism. Most all the tombs have shown signs damage from time &amp; the elements, with fallen 
monuments etc, but the vandalized ones are obliterated beyond repair.<br>

From the bottom right detailing up the row: <br>
The Peter T. &amp; W.H. Coover Obelisk stones appear o be standing above, but have now been 
pushed over and lie on the ground, both pointing eastward as seen in the photos.<br>
The Solomon Coover stone has fallen in the past and today is standing against 
its base.<br>
The Marthy Jane Coover stone is still standing.<br>
The Lethia M. Coover stone is standing<br>
The Sallie Coover &amp; Parks Townsend monument has fallen and is no longer standing 
except for the inscribed blocks, but this may not be the damage of vandals.<br>
Next row eastward:<br>
The Muntford R. Townsend stone has been severely vandalized. The thick 6&quot; stone 
lid is broken into many fragments by the blows of criminal vandals. They were 
stupid enough to think there was treasure or a body behind the lid. Neither is 
true in southern cemeteries. There are spiders, wasp and snakes though and I 
hope they reaped their share of those.<br>

This photo was made by J. Preston back in 2006. the stone was still standing and 
in good order then.<br>
<img border="0" src="IMG_3878--.JPG" width="640" height="480"><br>
This is the crushed parts of the Muntford R. Townsend box tomb today.<br>
</font><font color="#CC3300" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">
The Mary Ann Lucretia Townsend box tomb is broken and still stands together. Someone probably stacked it back together after the vandalism 
because the parts are not so heavy.<br>
The Rebeca F. Townsend stone has been broken. The top is broken and removed from the 
base and the sides are falling inward.<br>
The other three box tombs are covered by a large thicket of blackberry briars. 
As for me I don't plan on clearing them until it is a given the vandals will not return.<br>
Whom ever did this dastardly deed used heavy tools, because these are some of 
the heaviest box tombs I have seen.<br>
</font><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">
When found, I reported this vandalism to the Madison County Sheriff and they 
respectively took the report which I provided in detail. The officer also 
informed me that a teenager from the nearby High School had attacked this 
cemetery and caused the destruction a couple of years prior to my visit here. I 
was informed he had been prosecuted and punished and this was no longer an open 
case. </font></b><i><b><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
