SMITH CEMETERY, (Subdivision north of Nick Davis Rd), MADISON COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>

This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Smith Cemetery of Madison Co. Alabama. The location is indicated using a red 
check. So far as I know this is the only map that shows the correct location of 
the Smith Cemetery. The USGS plotting needs correcting. <br>

At the 
intersection of Nick Davis Road and Old Railroad Bed Road go east toward Wall-Triana 
Highway for about 1 mile and turn north on Lincarrie Lane into the subdivision. 
Go about a 1/4 mile and the cemetery is on the right in the corner before the 
road bends 90 degrees left. It is between two houses. Go here only in the Winter when the trees 
are dormant. You cannot pass into this thicket in the summertime.<br>

Notice the yellow pointer indicating the cemetery. The cemetery  
occupies all that dark green area which is now between two houses, just before 
the road bends back left 90 degrees.<br>

This map depicts the location. You can see the trees where the cemetery 
is located. It is upon a bank above the road on the right.<br>
