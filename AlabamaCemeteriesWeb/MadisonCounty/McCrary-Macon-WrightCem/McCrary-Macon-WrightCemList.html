<u>Notes</u><br>
Nancy Wright of this cemetery was a cousin to Betsy Wright of the old McCrary 
Cemetery. They were respectively 2nd &amp; 1st wives of Thomas McCrary b. 1789. 
Nancy bore all of Thomas' children.&nbsp; The Wright and McCrary's were two of Madison County's earliest pioneer 
families and owned adjoining plantations; their family histories are closely 
interwoven as you will see here.<br>
