		on Joe Quick aka New Market Road Turn left on Jimmy Fisk Road and go 
		past a thicket and turn left (with permission) into a field road that 
		goes east along the edge of a field. Notice the thicket on your right 
		after traveling less than a 1/4 mile. When you are closest to the 
		subject thicket stop the vehicle. and walk across the field and follow 
		along the edge until you get to the far south end and go into the 
		thicket back north about 20 yards to the (broken) cemetery. Vandals have 
		visited this place and broken up the box tombs but as of now the on only 
		surviving monument is for that of Adam Dale, the youth support Rev War 
		soldier born in 1768 and also Soldier of the War of 1812 under Andy 
		Jackson.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows where the cemetery is located more clearly in a grove of trees. 
		To get here please do not trample on the farmer's crops. You will 
		damage them even if you walk across it during certain times, but by all 
		means do not cross to this thicket in vehicles when the crops are in 
		growing-in-progress. In order to properly interface with permissions on 
		this visit you will likely need permission from the land owner who lives 
		in Huntsville and the crop lessee who can tell you when the best time to 
		visit. Growing in this photo above is cotton but in the winter and early 
		summer wheat grows here, but all that could change.&nbsp; </font></b><br>
