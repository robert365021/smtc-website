Adam Dale was the father of Alexander Jeffries' second wife, Elizabeth Dale. 
Elizabeth chose Jeffries as her third husband. After his death she married 
Robert High (an Alabama legislator) on May 15, 1839. He died in April 1842 and 
she then married Absalom Brown on March 16, 1846. He died in 1847. She married 
Willis Routt May 11, 1848 and some time after his death Elizabeth moved to 
Mississippi and died there. The imposing manor house that stood near the 
cemetery was Elizabeth's home from the time she married Jeffries until she moved 
to Mississippi and it is believed that Robert High, Absalom Brown. and Willis 
Routt are also buried here, but if they are they do not have tombstones. The 
house burned around 1968. The often-married Elizabeth was one of Madison 
County's most beautiful and colorful characters having even been accused of 
murder of at least for some of her six husbands at one time but she was acquitted 
before leaving for Mississippi. Bill Martin of Nashville a Dale descendent says 
he traced her on into Arkansas but has not found her grave. Since it is known 
even some or all of her own children were against her she is unlikely to have a 
headstone anywhere.<br>

	<dt><b>The Haunted House of Hazel Green</b></dt>
	<p>Built on an Indian mound several hundred yards from any other breach in 
	the earth's surface, the home of Mrs. Elizabeth E. Routt,, better known in 
	county history as Mrs. High Brown Routt, a mile east of Hazel Green, once 
	held the limelight of local attention, principally because it harbored more 
	scandal than any since and has kept folks awake around the fireside. </p>
	<p>Both books and pamphlet, now unobtainable, recorded this choice gossip, 
	and caused passersby, back in those days before the Civil War, to slacken 
	the reins upon their horses end strain their necks for a glance of the 
	mansion's owner. </p>
	<p>The home, built in 1847 in the heart of a 500-acre plantation, once was 
	beautiful, surrounded with flowers and well supplied with costly furniture. 
	Even its predecessor, a two-story log cabin immediately to the rear, bore 
	some charm. </p>
	<p>But its distinctiveness is gone now. No longer does it indicate that it 
	once sheltered wealth and aristocracy. The disasters of tenantry have 
	befallen it. </p>
	<p>History around this home lies almost altogether with Mrs. Routt. She 
	was, before her marriage, Elizabeth E. Dale, daughter of Adam Dale, 
	Volunteer Revolutionary Soldier at the age of 14, and member of a company of 
	boys raised in Snow Hill, Maryland in 1781. </p>
	<p>Her grandfather was Thomas Dale, who commanded two companies of &quot;Minute 
	Men&quot; sent to protect Salisbury, Md., Whig headquarters for that state, from 
	a Tory uprising in 1777. Adam, who died while visiting his daughter in 1851 
	and was buried there on the plantation, received, with his father, land 
	grants for service and removed to Tennessee in 1797. He later raised, 
	equipped and commanded a company from Smith Co., Tenn., and served under 
	Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812. </p>
	<p>Mrs. Routt was a beautiful and charming woman, with auburn hair, dark 
	brown eyes and fair complexion. She was well educated, an aristocrat and had 
	in her veins the blue blood of men who had followed in the steps of Lord 
	Baltimore and Cecil Calvert. She loved fine clothes, fine horses, fine 
	furnishings and all conveniences made possible by the considerable wealth of 
	her family. Her appeal to men was unusual. </p>
	<p>Before she was wooed by Alexander Jeffries, a widower and early settler 
	from Madison County, she was married twice, first to a Gibbons and then to a 
	Flannigan, both of whom had died rather mysteriously a short while after, 
	leaving no children. </p>
	<p>Jeffries had started the plantation at Hazel Green long before he met 
	Mrs. Routt. In 1817, he had bought from Archibald Patterson the northeast 
	quarter of a section for $1,800., and had followed this the next year with 
	the purchase of the east end of a quarter of an adjoining section from 
	Thomas Murphy for $700. Both tracts were entered by these former owners in 
	1812. </p>
	<p>Then had come for Jeffries the task of clearing this acreage end of 
	constructing the log house, which was to be a fairly spacious structure of 
	its kind with four rooms. He had chosen the Indian mound for its site so 
	that he could from this higher point, look out upon the virgin forests and 
	sparsely wooded country around him. </p>
	<p>When the fields were cleared, he had planted them in cotton, a crop found 
	by earlier settlers to be well adapted to this section. Slaves had been 
	added as he needed them advancing both his investments and his fortune. </p>
	<p>Not long after the death of his first wife, he had visited Tennessee on 
	business and had met Mrs. Flannigan, as Mrs. Routt was known then. Her 
	fascination had led to courtship which resulted in their marriage. </p>
	<p>Two children were born to this couple, William A. and Mary Elizabeth. The 
	daughter's birth occurred November 8, 1837, and her death August 13, 1844. 
	She was buried on the plantation. </p>
	<p>In 1837, Jeffries died, at the age of 65. Whether there was any suspicion 
	concerning the cause of his death is not known, for his will, filed the next 
	year, states that he was in bad health, though of sound mind. </p>
	<p>In taking over the plantation, his widow found little trouble. She drove 
	her slaves with an iron hand, terrorizing them with the fury of her 
	commands, and slyly began to look about for another &quot;lord. &quot; </p>
	<p>Robert A. High of Limestone County, a native of North Carolina, was the 
	next to succumb to her wiles. This man was a representative in the state 
	legislature from 1838 to 1839, and was a zealous advocate of common schools. 
	William Garrett, author of &quot;Public Men in Alabama, &quot;writes of him as 
	follows: <br>
&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		&quot;At the time he served in the capitol, he was a dashing widower, seeking 
		his fourth wife. His head was 
		a little bald, which fact he took great pains to conceal.. He filled a 
		large space in society at Tuscaloosa 
		and succeeded in marrying before his term of office expired. &quot;</ul>
	But High lived only a few years after his marriage to Mrs. Jeffries on May 
	15, 1839, dying in April, 1842. The widow's next choice was Absalom Brown, 
	merchant of New Market, whose wife she became on March 16, 1846. 
	<p>Mrs. Routt had planned for years a fine home to which she might invite 
	her guests, some of whom were members of Madison County's most prominent 
	families. After this betrothal with Brown, she began the present structure, 
	which required a Negro slave carpenter more than a year to complete, even 
	with all his assistants. </p>
	<p>The frame house, facing the east, was ell-shaped and had eight large 
	rooms, four above and four below. Two stairways connected the two floors, 
	one in the hallway separating the four chambers in front and the other 
	midway between the front and back </p>
	<p>The front hall was of moderate dimensions, with an opening at each end. 
	The main door was in two panels bordered with tiny panes of glass. Only a 
	few feet from the north side of the building and at the foot of the mound on 
	which it was erected ran the road from Hazel Green which intersected a few 
	hundred yards to the front of the house with a lane bordered by a dozen or 
	so slave cottages. </p>
	<p>No more care was taken in preparing this mansion than was placed in the 
	layout of its surroundings. A row of tall cedars and pines around the hill 
	circled bed upon bed of all kinds of flowers and shrubs. Bear grass was 
	planted along the main walk in front of the dwelling, while shrubbery of 
	some nature skirted even the brick walks which led toward the stables and 
	icehouse to the rear. </p>
	<p>Furnishings were the richest obtainable. In this respect Mrs. Routt was 
	never satisfied, for she had in mind tall mirrors and costly mantlepieces, 
	items she did not acquire before she lost her fortune. </p>
	<p>When completed, this home was not a lonely abode there amid its curtain 
	of trees. Often, its owner took in travelers for the night, while again, she 
	returned from a trip to Columbia, Tenn., with guests for a house party and 
	other festivities. Every convenience was furnished them, even servants' 
	bells in each room. </p>
	<p>Brown died in 1847, of some unknown malady which caused his body to swell 
	so that it was necessary that he be buried during the night following his 
	death. Present residents of the county recall that their parents and grand 
	parents often remarked on their part in this ceremony there in the dark, 
	aided only by lantern light, held by shaking darkies. </p>
	<p>But this was not the end of the widow's matrimonial ventures. On May 11 
	of the following year, she was married to Willis Routt, her sixth husband. 
	He, too, passed the way of the others within a short while. </p>
	<p>Around this time, Mrs. Routt became engaged a controversy with Abner Tate 
	which eventually led to her trial in the courts in Huntsville on a charge of 
	murdering her husbands, but she never was convicted. </p>
	<p>Tate, a neighbor, had several squabbles with her over loose livestock and 
	other plantation matters. They confessed no liking whatever for each other. 
	Tate was blind to her beauty and openly charged her with murder. Consistent 
	with this accusation was the rumor, substantial by sight, that the woman had 
	a hat rack in the main hallway of her home upon which she bung each 
	hushand's hat after his death. </p>
	<p>Mrs. Routt sought to put and end to this enemy of her. In 1854, Tate was 
	wounded by a shotgun in the hands of of one of his slaves. Rumor had it that 
	his neighbor paid one of her slaves to shoot him, and that this Negro, in 
	turn, had hired one of the victim's men to commit the deed. </p>
	<p>That failing, Mrs. Routt next turned to a cleverer scheme. She had been 
	receiving much attention from D. H. Bingham, a school teacher at 
	Meridianville, who desired her hand in marriage, for this woman was 
	beautiful even at 60. So when it was reported that a drover from Kentucky, 
	on his way back from selling his herd in South Alabama, had been murdered at 
	Tate's home and cremated in a large fireplace there, she had this suitor 
	prefer charges against him. </p>
	<p>Tate answered these accusations in a book called &quot;Defense of Abner Tate 
	Against Charges of Murder Preferred by D. H. Bingham. &quot; He also struck even 
	further at Mrs. Routt, charging that her &quot;bridal chamber was a charnel 
	house,&quot; and spoke of her as the woman &quot;around whose marriage couch six 
	grinning skeletons were already hung. &quot; </p>
	<p>This book led Mrs. Routt to file a $50,000 damage suit against its author 
	for defaming her character. The following quotations from Tate's book were 
	taken from the circuit court records of 1857, the year after the suit was 
	entered: </p>
	<ul>
		&quot;poor soul - she is alone - she ought to have a husband, an industrious, 
		sober husband like D. H. Bingham! She has not been particularly 
		fortunate in that respect heretofore, and in Bingham's opinion was 
		entitled to all the consolation an industrious, sober man can bring to 
		the bed around which nightly assembles a conclave of ghosts to witness 
		the endearments that once were theirs, and shudder through their 
		fleshless forms at the fiendish spirit which wraps the grave worm in the 
		bridal -garment and enforces a lingering death with a conjugal kiss. The 
		worst fate I could wish for Bingham would be the success of his 
		undertaking, but I doubt whether the prize will ever be his. He is 
		dealing with a shrewd, bad woman, and she may calculate that she can 
		induce him to goad me beyond endurance on the ... day ... 1856. &quot;</ul>
	Then later in the record comes this quotation: <br>
&nbsp;<ul>
		&quot;I say for money, because I cannot believe even in him any amorous 
		passion mingled with his feverish anxiety to get possession of the hand 
		of Elizabeth Routt. He knew her past history. He knew that she offered 
		herself as a reward to him only on the condition that he accomplished a 
		murder. If he succeeded, every time her lips touched his, desire must 
		have fled in horror, as if from the cold, clammy taste of a putrid 
		corpse. He would indeed have waded through my blood, and the tears of a 
		heartbroken wife and a host of agonizing relatives, to the possession of 
		her property, but her person he could not touch. The clasp of her arms 
		around his neck would call up dreadful shapes to sit upon his dreary 
		pillow end make his nights as fearful <br>
&nbsp;<ul>
			As if the dead could feel <br>
			The icy worm around them steal, <br>
			And shudder as the reptiles creep <br>
			To revel o'er their rotting sleep. &quot; <br>
&nbsp;</ul>
	</ul>
	The evidence presented in the record closed as follows: <br>
&nbsp;<ul>
		&quot;Mr. Bingham has failed but he deserves the possession of the venerable 
		bride; I trust that happiness will not be denied him. The union is one 
		so eminently fit and proper that it would be a pity to prevent its 
		accomplishment. There is no crime, no vice, no detestable meanness that 
		is not familiar to one or both of them, and though the deed should flee 
		away in shuddering horror from the bride, there will be enough of 
		grinning friends to witness the ceremony end congratulate the happy pair 
		on the. . . day of April 1856. &quot;</ul>
	This case, however, never was decided, for Mrs. sold the home to Levi 
	Donaldson in 1855 and went with son, William A. Jeffries, to Marshal! 
	County, Mississippi later dismissing the suit. Whether or not she married 
	Bingham is unknown. 
	<p>Other quotations, from the chancery court record of 1858, point to the 
	suspicion with which Mrs. Routt was held. She 
	sued Abner Tate and Jacob H. Pierce for $1400. that she claimed they owed 
	her for her cotton crop of 1840. The
	following letter, presented in the case, was written to her by Pierce in 
	1843: <br>
&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		&quot;Madam, in the name of God, do you intend to try to ruin me? When I have 
		protected your interest ever since the death of your late husband 
		Alexander Jeffries, in thousands of instances? Lest your mind should be 
		treacherous, I will name a few. After the death of Mr. Jeffries, when 
		his children should have been your friends, but instead of that, they 
		were your most inveterate enemies and even went so far as to say you 
		were the cause of his death, which was reported from one end of the 
		county to the other. Who were your friends ?. . . &quot;</ul>
	And Mrs. Routt replied: <ul>
		&quot;I received your letter by father late on Friday evening, and company 
		came in just at that time, so I had no time to write until I got home 
		from church this afternoon. I am sorry to find your feelings are hurt 
		with me, for I never intended to say or do anything to hurt you in any 
		respect. Your kindness to me I do esteem in the highest, and ever shall, 
		for I always have believed you to be my friend, and you may rest assured 
		that I will not nor never intend to sue you.. . &quot;</ul>
	Then came the following postscript: <ul>
		&quot;I intended to have sent this last evening, but on account of Mary E. 
		having a chill at church, it detained me so that when I was done 
		writing, it was too late to send it. Then I thought I would get father 
		to hand it to you in Huntsville, but finding you will be at home today, 
		I will send it there. I hope all will be well yet. I am your friend. . . 
		&quot; <br>
&nbsp;</ul>
	Donaldson, grandfather of Mrs. A. D. Rogers of Huntsville, who was married 
	in the home, bought the plantation for $12,500. He lived there until his 
	death in 1874, then passed it on to his heirs who kept it until 1902. 
	<p>Few things about the mansion now mark the wealth which once paid for its 
	upkeep. There is no orderliness, no neatness in its vicinity. The structure 
	has become ramshackle and prone to the whims of its occupants. Doors sag, 
	window panes are missing, and plastering has fallen by the wholesale. On the 
	north side of the house, two brass door knobs appear conspicuously out of 
	place. </p>
	<p>Only one forgotten item about the plantation remains in memory of the 
	woman who lived there three-quarters of a century ago - the graveyard. A few 
	yards to the south of the house, beneath an immense holly tree. surrounded 
	by a low thicket, tombstones lie in a random pile - that of husband, child 
	and ancestor, a harbor for reptiles and field mice. </p>
	<p>Note: The High-Brown-Routt home burned to the ground in the fall of 1968. 
	From the main road, skeletal remains of two chimneys are the only visible 
	evidence that a house, once stood on the ancient Indian mound. </p>
