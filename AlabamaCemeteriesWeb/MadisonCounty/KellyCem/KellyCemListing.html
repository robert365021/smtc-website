<p><b><br>
In the corner of this cemetery not far from the stones of William and 
Katherine (Wesson) Kelly, there is a large area with no tombstones. It is said 
that two infants and two unmarried daughters of William and Katherine Kelly are 
probably buried there. The would be (dates from Bible) Josiah Phillips Kelly, 
(1841-1841); Joshua Littleton Kelly (1844-1845); Emma Louise Kelly
(1846-1874); and Nancy Rebecca Kelly (1852-1872).</b></p>
<p><b>About 1920, after the cemetery had been neglected for many years, Messrs.&nbsp; 
D. E. Kelly, J. O. Kelly and G. L. Kelly, brothers (all deceased), undertook a 
reclaim and preserve the lot. They enclosed it with the present fence and as 
there were many graves with no stones they had a number of concrete markers 
made.&nbsp; They did the best they could to place these at the correct graves. 
The names were <br>
put on but they made no attempt to put dates on the markers and there may still 
be some unmarked graves. <br>
In the early 1930's, when a grave was being dug for a member of the Phillips 
family, those digging the grave found they had dug into an unmarked grave. The 
Kelly family attempted to determine the identity of the person buried there but 
was unsuccessful, therefore, the site of this grave has no marker. <br>
<br>
</b><b>**David E. 
and William J. Kelly were brothers and the sons of Jesse and Martha (Phillips) 
Kelly, both of whom lived and died in Brunswick Co., Va. Another brother of 
David E. and William J. was Josiah S. Kelly who is not buried here. The only 
sister of these Kelly brothers (there wore 4 other brothers not buried hem) was 
Elizabeth Moore (Kelly) House, the wife of Isaac House. She also has some 
descendants buried here although she and her husband lived and died in 
Williamson Co. , Tenn. The Bibles of David E. , William J. , and Josiah S. Kelly 
have been preserved and many of the dates missing on the hand concrete markers 
have been supplied from these Bibles. <br>

The information on this cemetery and the Kelly genealogy was supplied by Mrs. R.

is so thorough and her notes are so interesting that I have chosen to include 
them in their entirety. The only additions are the marriage and the census

was shown in the book Madison County Cemeteries Vol II pages 169-172 by the 
Dorothy Johnson. She did a tremendous job on it and no one can top her 
presentation given the original sources she had. I don't know why this cemetery book was 
not in print. Well yes I do know because there was no enough support from the 
Historical Society, as should have been. I for one don't plan on replacing her 
book. my county coverage will fall short much more so than hers. If you get a 
chance to obtain this two volume edition you will be pleased with its 
completeness. While Findagrave.com seems to have much family history, as a site 
it is sadly lacking in graveyard location &amp; science with minor exceptions. That 
is because it often misses grave locations by many miles and and across county 
lines due to the complex issue that there are so many cemetery names that are 
the same the unwary researcher easily falls into the trap of error there in a 
split second of indecision in completing the record. Most have no knowledge base 
of the county research by previous cemetery researchers.<br>
