This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Kelly Cemetery. This is at GPS coordinates of N 34.8106 W -86.6463. 
Alternate Location: Section 5 Township 3S Range 1W. NW NW SE NE. Located 
directly behind a large frame house built about 1830 by David Emmit Kelly on 
Kelly Cemetery Road. The house was sold out of the Kelly family in 1878 but the 
cemetery is still maintained by the Kelly family.<br>

&nbsp;Go out Research Blvd to Kelly Cemetery Road and turn right (east) and go 
less than a mile and the cemetery is behind the a home. The next home has a 
right of way road back to the cemetery, but I still think it best to get 
permission from the homeowner in front (due north) of the cemetery.<br>

Notice the yellow Cem indicating the cemetery location occupying an area inside a 
fence. <br>
