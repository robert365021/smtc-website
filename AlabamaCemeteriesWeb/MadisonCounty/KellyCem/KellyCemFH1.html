The Lillie Davison and the infant daughter were twins. Note: Eight of the 
nine children of Amanda M. (Kelly) and Samuel E. Davison are listed above. 
Another daughter, Laura, born c. 1870 (from census records) died in infancy, is 
buried here but has no stone. After Amanda died Samuel Davison married a second 
time and had a son and two daughters, none of whom married. Thus, this man 
fathered 12 children and not a single one of them married although several lived 
many years. <br>
