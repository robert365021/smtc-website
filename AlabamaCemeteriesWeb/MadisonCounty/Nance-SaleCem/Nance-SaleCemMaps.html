This map shows the GPS of
the Nance-Sale Cemetery. This is at GPS coordinates of N 34.84275 W -86.665897. Alternate 
Location: Section 30 Township 2S Range 1W - S/2 SE NE NW NE. On Burwell Road.<br>

&nbsp;At the 
intersection of Highway 53 and Burwell Road go out Burwell Road toward the 
northeast and after about a mile the road bends back east. Continue on about another mile 
and look left at the cemetery nearly on the bank of the road and southwest of a 
nice home. Permission lies with the owner of the home this cemetery nearly lies 
in the yard of. The official name of this cemetery should be Sale-Nance Cemetery 
because the Sale family founded this place and also the cemetery. However since 
it is named the Nance Cemetery on mapping I chose to stay with Nance-Sale so 
name recognition is easier.<br>

Notice the yellow labeling indicating the cemetery, an old now extinct home place 
and an old nearby barn. Believe the home was south of the yellow marking about 
75 yards. <br>
