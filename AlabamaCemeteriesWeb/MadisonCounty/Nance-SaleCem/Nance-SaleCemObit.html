Note: Obituary of Capt. Dudley Sale:<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>Captain Dudley Sale was born in Amherst County, Virginia, October 25, 1781, 
moved to Georgia with his parents when quite young. He emigrated to Madison Co., 
Ala. in 1814 when it was but newly settled. He first settled on Beaver Dam Creek 
near Meridianville; soon afterwards he purchased the place where his<br>
residence now stands. Here he raised a family of twelve children, who with him 
were not only respected but loved by everyone. He possessed great business<br>
qualities, far above ordinary men. He had been a member of the M. E. (Methodist 
Episcopal) Church, South, for more than 40 years and perhaps there was no man 
ever lived who had fewer enemies than he. He was twice happily married and in 
both instances a most devoted husband. He died January 16, 1867 leaving a wife, 
three children, 13 grandchildren and many great-grandchildren.&quot;</i><br>
<br>
The old Sale-Nance plantation home which once graced this site was built in 1830 
and was located across Burwell Road from the cemetery. When I first visited it 
in November of 1968 it had been abandoned several years and was in such a sad 
state of disrepair that the second floor had fallen onto the ground level. 
Later, a severe wind-storm finished crumbling the old white, clapboard home. 
Only the chimney now stands, and in it is one brick with the date &quot;1830&quot; clearly 
outlined for all to see. [Dorothy Scott Johnson 1978]<br>
Nothing remains of the old place today except the graveyard as of my visit on 9 
Nov 2012. However the place across the road where the home was located is now 
dense forest. One photo captures in the distance an old decaying barn with the 
roof almost gone which obviously dates to that period. 

<a href="IMG_0733-.JPG">0733C</a> The barn is on 
the same side of Burwell Road as the cemetery. Sure hope someone preserved the 
brick that was inscribed as &quot;1830&quot; [CWA 17 May 2014]<br>
