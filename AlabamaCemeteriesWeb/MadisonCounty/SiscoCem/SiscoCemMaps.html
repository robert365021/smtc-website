From Huntsville go out Winchester Rd several miles past Bell Factory to County 
Lake Road and turn (east) right. Go less than a half mile and turn left on Fussy Hill 
Rd. Follow that a mile or so until it dead ends into Hurricane Rd. Turn north 
(left) on Hurricane Rd and go two mile and pass Ray Road turn off on the right 
and go about another 3/4 mile to the Bragg Cemetery Road on the right. Turn into 
Bragg Cemetery which doubles as a farm road and residential access and go 2 to 4 
hundred yards to just before the Bragg Cemetery on right. Park and with 
permission walk (left) north to the thicket in the distance which contains the 
cemetery. You may encounter insurmountable fences (do not trample on them) on 
this route so ask at the nearby homes for the designated path to the cemetery. I 
have given you the route with the least amount of walking.<br>
