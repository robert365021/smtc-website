From Hwy 72 go south in Madison down Hughes Road past the Madison Church of 
Christ on your right and then the medical building next right then look right 
(east) at the next two buildings. Between them is the two parking lots serving 
these buildings. Park 
in the back next to the curb and draw a line from the center curb (ease west) 
straight up the incline and walk up that incline thru the thicket 50 yards to 
the cemetery under today a large Cedar tree. When you see the mourners bench the 
cemetery is just past that as in the photo below.<br>
