<p><b>What I found was a 
hodge podge of (vandalized) misplaced pieces of stone for this cemetery. This 
was mixed in with a bunch of old rotten lumber and a fallen log. I set 
about trying to gather the separated parts into one set of stones. I found I 
had only four inscriptions on three stones, and some other parts without inscription which 
were probably footstones. There were bases still intact in the ground. There 
was no clear way to get the parts set over the graves except some of them 
protruded from the ground next to the bench leaving future work there. Roland &amp; 
Elizabeth Gooch, William Dublin &amp; George W. Gooch are the stones found and 
assembled. They were broken up and scattered about. I actually put some of them 
together graphically as I figured out more of them from the photos than actually 
on site. This was evidently the grounds of an old Methodist Church, so there 
must be many more unmarked graves. I could easily identify two of those but deep 
leaves covered many others I presume.</b></p>
<p><b>I cut a path thru the 
brush to this cemetery for future visitors. That was mostly eliminating 
thorny pear limbs.&nbsp; That is from the side on the parking lot of the 
building along Hughes Road to the cemetery which is the best access. This is 
between building address 411 &amp; 401 Hughes Road which lines up with the cemetery 50 yards 
away. </b></p>
