<u>At the foot of T. H. Bayless's grave</u> is a large fieldstone marking a separate 
grave, that of an unknown woman. She took ill on the stage which traveled between 
Winchester, Tenn. and
Huntsville, Ala. Since this was a stage stop for a change of horses, the lady 
got off the stage and was going to stay at the Bayless home until she recovered, 
however, she died.
This occurred during the Civil War and her son was in the Confederate army. 
After the war the son visited her grave with intentions of erecting a monument 
but for some reason he
did not. The name of the lady has been forgotten.<br>

Note: When Dorothy Johnson copied this cemetery about 1970 this farm was owned and occupied by Mr. and 
Mrs. Harry K. Lawler (born 1885). Even though Mr. Lawler was elderly he was spry 
and his mind was as alert
as a youngster's. He was well acquainted with the history of the community, with 
his farm, and the people buried in the Bayless cemetery behind his barn. Mr. Lawler was able
to supply information on some of the people buried here.<br>

ROJO DRAKEY, 1988 - 2004, Our faithful Companion, A dog or horse or pet of some 
kind. <u>Folks I do not recommend burial of pets in a human cemetery</u>. I 
think it is disrespectful to the folks buried here to reduce them to the status 
of an animal and hey I love my kitty kat too. I feel so strongly about this that 
I may consider a suit or charges to have this grave removed in light of the fact 
that this is an ancestral cemetery of my wife. There are plenty of reputable pet 
cemeteries around. It is or should be against the law. Maybe someone should 
start a cemetery just for folks that want to be buried with their dogs or pets, 
but as for me and mine, people have a soul and animals do not belong in the same 
graveyard. Read your Bible. Even if you don't believe the Bible it is still 
disgusting. Imagine 100 years is past and the only part of this inscription that 
survived a tree falling on it is ROJO DRAKEY. Now you've got major confusion of 
great proportion. Someone would be asking who is heck is Rojo Drakey?? <b>
