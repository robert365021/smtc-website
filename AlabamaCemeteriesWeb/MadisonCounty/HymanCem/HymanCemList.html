<p><b><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">* This stone is no longer completely 
readable with missing chunks of the left edge of the stone crumbling away.<br>
**I saw &amp; photographed other stones, but only found the one inscription.&nbsp; 
The knowledge of this cemetery could be nearly lost. The stones were in a very 
large area full of massive oak trees and saw briars pricking away at ones 
patience leaving moving around a major challenge. In an environment like that it 
is impossible to make an assessment as to how many unmarked graves are present. The stones were in the western 
section of the central part of the cemetery, but the findings are sparse.&nbsp; 
See Dorothy Johnson's book Cemeteries of Madison County&nbsp; The above stones 
were two of the most difficult stones to read I ever attempted. Fahs could have been &quot;Enas&quot; or almost anything. Dr. and Mrs. Ezell 
Terry read the .stone as &quot;Mary Ann Hyman.&quot;</font></b></p>
