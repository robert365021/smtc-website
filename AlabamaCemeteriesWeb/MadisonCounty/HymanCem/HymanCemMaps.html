From Huntsville go up Hwy 231 Northward to Steger Rd and turn right. Follow that 
east as it bends back north then back east and becomes Moores Mill Rd. Turn 
south (right) on Moores Mill Rd and go to the Flint River Baptist Church and look across 
the Church cemetery at a plowed field and tree lined thicket about 300 yards 
from the road.<br>
