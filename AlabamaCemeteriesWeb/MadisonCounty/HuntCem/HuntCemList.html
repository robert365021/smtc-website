At first thought it seems a good idea to clear a cemetery by using fire. However 
that really means these stones will start to crumble in a few years. The severe 
heat softens the stone and in time causes them to begin to crumble as they react 
to the heat, cold, wet &amp; dry. So no more burning and also try to keep the brush 
away from a cemetery so accidental fires do not burn the stones. [CWA 14 Apr
