Map incorrectly labels this the Riverton Rd. That is incorrect.

From Huntsville go out Winchester Rd and turn north on Moores Mill Rd and then 
right again on Moores Mill Rd when it bends. After 2+ miles bear right on Darwin Rd 
and go to Macon 
Lane. Take a right on Macon and go about 1/2 mile to see the two little stones on the 
right (west) side of the road. Also has a sign: Hunt Cemetery.<br>

This close up photo view shows the two small stones of the cemetery. I don't 
know who the idiot is that burned this cemetery but that probably means the 
stones will start to crumble in a few years as it softens the stone. In time 
they can begin to crumble as they react to the heat and cold or changing 
temperatures. Another thing is the sign pole will now rust and fail in time.<br>
