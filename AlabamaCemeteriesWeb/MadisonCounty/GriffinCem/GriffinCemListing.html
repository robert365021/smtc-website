*Since there were unlikely to be children by this late marriage it is probable 
that she chose or her children made the decision to be buried by her earlier husband Joseph Griffin. A son Joseph Casen Griffin, was the first born of Joseph and Charity. Charity was the 2nd 
wife of Joseph b. 1767.<br>
<br>
These previously lost stones turned up in a barn yard with stones that were 
newly set since about 1950. They are in danger of being lost. They are flat in 
the ground and only by the efforts of the the farm caretaker are they not 
being trampled by large farm equipment &amp; livestock. The caretaker showed me 
where he had placed two 
poles seen in the photo above next to the stones to keep them visible.</font></b></p>

Hello Wayne:<br>
<br>
I saw your recent posting of a headstone for Joseph Griffin b. 1767 in South 
Carolina and d. April, 1851, in Madison County, Alabama. <br>
Joseph Griffin is my 4th Great-Grandpa. I’m really surprised to see this! I see 
your notes about the location, and if I’m reading your Griffin Cemetery notes 
correctly, this is a replacement stone that was made. It is curious that Charity 
also has a stone there, since <br>
she later remarried a Hobbs in 1857 after Joseph’s death and I’d be surprised 
that she was buried on Joseph’s property. My 3rd Great-Grandpa,&nbsp; Joseph 
Casen Griffin, was the first born of Joseph and Charity (Charity was his 2nd 
wife).<br>
There are notes in the Madison County cemetery records that there was a small 
footstone that listed “J.G.,” and the landowner at the time, name not provided, 
indicated that the original headstone had been damaged in a fire on the 
property, but Joseph had been buried on his property. The property at the time 
of the interview was known as the Jenkins Place.<br>
<br>
“On a nearby farm, known then as a “Jenkins place” a footstone marked J.G. the 
owner said the headstone had been destroyed by heat from a fire but he was 
buried about 70 years ago, and his age stated as 86.” (Alabama Records 235, page 
57)<br>
<br>
I was in Alabama on a visit in October 2012 and we drove up to Merdianville to 
see Joseph’s land, 160 acres. I’m wondering if you might have any contact 
information for the farm manager you spoke with. I’d be interested in contacting 
them and determining the location specifically.&nbsp; We will be visiting again 
in October this year and I would very much like to see the stones and learn 
anything more the manager may know. We are so pleased to see that the marker 
stones are there and being protected, even if they aren’t the originals, to 
remember Joseph and Charity. Our family would be honored to be able to visit and 
see them and the property. Our information on the property was that the land was 
off the southwest corner of Lebanon Rd. and Patterson Lane. We did drive down 
Monroe Rd.&nbsp; and I’m familiar with that area and views from Google Earth. 
There was some information also that Joseph had 80 acres off of Monroe Rd also, 
but the larger farm was the 160 at the location above.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
