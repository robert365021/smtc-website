This Aerial map shows the GPS of
the Griffin Cemetery under the white check. The GPS is calculated as N 34.85533 X W -86.62726. 
This map shows the farm road going by the cemetery site. It is a private road.<br>

&nbsp;Go up Hwy 231/431 past Meridianville to Monroe Rd and turn left (west). 
When the road bends back left a farm road to the left is available which goes 
back southeast. There is a locked gate there. You will need to see the farm 
manager to view these monuments. I think he lives across the road. When I was 
there he was there too which made the task for me easier. As a rule I don't give 
out names without permission.<br>

Notice the green balloon indicating the cemetery location occupying an open area 
to the east of he small barn. One can see the stones as two light spots just 
above the tree shadow, on the ground under and just north of the green arrow. North out of the reach of this image is 
the 
old chimney where the old home stood at one time.<br>
