This aerial map shows the GPS of
the Sanford Cemetery. N 34.73608 X W 86.42190. Alternative
Location: Township 3S Range 2E, Section 33, NE NE SE NW - South of Stone Drive out in 
a large field.<br>
<img border="0" src="SanfordCemRd.jpg" width="1920" height="967"><br>
&nbsp;Go east out Hwy 72 from Huntsville and after passing Moores Mill Road 
continue on to Brock Road and turn (left) north. After you cross the Railroad 
Tracks turn right on Stone Drive and go about 1/2 mile to the cemetery on the 
left out in a field in a clump of trees. There is a right of way whereby the 
path is maintained to the cemetery and not cultivated.&nbsp; <br>

Notice the brushy clump of trees in the distance about 250 yards away where this 
long abandoned cemetery can be found. Looks like a right of way is being 
maintained by the land owner, but no visitors who care about its upkeep are 
going to this cemetery. The name of the cemetery is spelled incorrectly on 
Google maps as Stanford.<br>
