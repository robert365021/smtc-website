<p>There may have been more graves (with tombstones) in this cemetery at one 
time but if so the stones are no longer there. This cemetery is now in a cow 
pasture and the stones are lying on the ground, knocked over and broken by 
milling cattle. Fast Forward to 2014 the Cattle are no longer there but the 
damage is severe to this cemetery with only one standing stone found and the 
others in many fragments on the ground. I made the usual effort to reassemble the 
parts in hopes that they well stay together for the visitor to read as a whole 
tombstone. However many of the grave locations are lost and unrecoverable 
without expensive high tech gear.<br>
<br>
I saw a poisonous Copperhead snake in this cemetery. He slithered out from under 
a piece of tin when he was disturbed. He quickly vanished from sight into one of 
the many ground hog holes in this cemetery. First 
poisonous snake I have seen in 30+ years in the wild. Glad I had the high top 
boots on and was also careful where I placed my hands around those broken stones 
in attempting to reassemble them. [CWA 1 Sep 2014]<br>
