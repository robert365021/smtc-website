<p><b><font face="Courier New" color="#000080">McCALEB, William, birth: abt 
1809, Virginia - death: abt 1875 Madison County Alabama<br>
<br>
Buried in the MaCaleb family cemetery located on the north side of Grimwood Road 
without a headstone. In fact no one in this cemetery has a headstone today.<br>
Born about 1809 he was 51 years old in the 27 Jun 1860 Federal census, living in 
the Northwestern District of Madison County with wife Susan and these children 
in the household:<br>
<br>
William McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 (born in Virginia)<br>
Susan McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 44<br>
Roda McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22<br>
John W McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br>
Nancy E McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18<br>
Marsha A McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16<br>
Millia McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14<br>
Susan &quot;S.E.&quot;McCaleb 12 (married John A. Bayless.)<br>
Epsy E McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7<br>
Sarah J McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br>
Joseph E McCaleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Courier New">By 1880 William McCaleb no longer shows up in 
the censuses suggesting his demise. His wife Susan &amp; the remaining children have 
moved in with the nearby John A. Bayless family whose wife Susan E. McCaleb 
Bayless was the daughter of William &amp; Susan McCaleb. So we average his death 
year as 1875. We will add 1875 and ask fellow researchers to correct this death 
date if the known death date ever surfaces.<br>
<br>
William served in the 15th Alabama Calvary Regiment - Civil War Military Unit A<br>

When Dorothy Scott Johnson visited this cemetery in 1970 she found there 
were no inscribed stones. The land was owned then by Mr. and Mrs. C. Franklin Bendall who bought it from Mr. J. O. Fisk. At least one of Mr. Fisk's ancestors 
is buried here but the cemetery is actually the old McCaleb family cemetery. 
Faint outline of a fence or rock wall is seen from Google maps facing the right 
direction. All this indicates this place to be an old lost cemetery. So we see thru mapping and record keeping 
we know the name of this cemetery but not the deceased inhabitants thereof. [C.

This cemetery is also called the McCaleb-Fisk Cemetery.<br>
