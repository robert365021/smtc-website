<p>People living in the area say there are several people 
buried here, however, they do not know who they are and only two stones have 
survived. [DSJ 1985] Some of these lost burials may be of the surname Bragg such as h. &amp; w. Thomas B., b 
1802 &amp; Sarah Sally Bayless Bragg, b. 1805 Widowed Sarah Sally Bragg was found a 
couple of houses removed from the Power family in 1850 and cannot be located in 
a graveyard. However there are other lost cemeteries along Frank Hereford road 
with unmarked graves that I have been unable to explore including many lost 
graves in the nearby Jacks Cemetery. Their son Sanford Bragg and his wife 
Elizabeth Ford are also missing from the graveyards in that neighborhood. [CWA
