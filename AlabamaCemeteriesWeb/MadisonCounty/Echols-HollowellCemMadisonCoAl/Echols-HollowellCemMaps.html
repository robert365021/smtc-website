From Hwy 231 take Steger Rd east for something less than 3 miles and at the 
intersection of Moores Mill &amp; Steger Road turn right into the new subdivision. 
At the first road left (subdivision circle) go to the end of the road and there 
in the thicket is the fallen stones of this cemetery. I knocked on the next door 
house to alert neighbors of my visit and accidentally awakened a sleeping police 
officer. Now that is a major opps. Shift workers need their 
rest. Sorry, but maybe I didn't otherwise cause any alarm. The first map above 
shows the only house next to the cemetery as of now on the south side of the 
cemetery.<br>

Notice the red check indicating the cemetery location occupying some of the lots 
in a subdivision. This map was cut before any houses were built on the Cozy 
Creek Circle (or road)<br>
