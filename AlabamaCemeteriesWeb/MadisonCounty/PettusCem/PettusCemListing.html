</i>*Note: Next to this grave is an adult size &quot;sink&quot; which maybe the grave of the father of these Thompson children, 
James Henry Thompson who died in 1901.  There is no marker at this grave.  Mrs. Richard Gilliam has in her possession 
a letter dated October 30, 1880 and written by Mary Susannah Garvin Thompson, the children's grandmother.  
The letter states that William Robadore died Oct 9, 1880 and that her own mother (Eveline Haws Garvin) died 
Oct 19, 1880.  Mary Susannah Garvin Thompson was the wife of Rufus Morgan Thompson.  I assume that William 
Rabadore did in fact die Oct 1880 and that the date on the tombstone is incorrect.  The Thompson children, 
above, were the children of James Henry Thompson &amp; Williamette Dixie Pettus. [source: Madison County Alabama

<PRE>In this cemetery I could not see and find some of the stones. About all of them were broken and the tops needed 
to be found &amp; relocated to their bases to be photographed (and possibly saved),  but some of the tops were
not found due to the Poison Ivy and Periwinkle vines being knee deep or they were just not there because of vandals.</PRE>
