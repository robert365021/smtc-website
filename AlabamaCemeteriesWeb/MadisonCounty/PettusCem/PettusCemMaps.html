PETTUS CEMETERY, (N. of Pettus Road in a grove of trees just W. of a subdivision), MADISON COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>
<img border="0" src="PettusCemtopo.jpg" width="701" height="561"><br>
This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Pettus Cemetery of Madison Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map. <br>
<img border="0" src="PettusCemRd.jpg" width="999" height="635"> At the 
intersection of Wall Triana Highway and Pine Grove Road go east on Pine Grove 
road then south (right) on Pettus Road then back east to Hillsgate Drive. Travel 
north on that to Dunloe Dr&nbsp; and turn left. Park back from the end of the 
street and with permission walk north following a path past the east side of a 
pond and into the woods. The cemetery is near the front (eastern edge) of the 
woods about half way into there. Someone has added a bench along the 
trail and other indications of a sanctuary. To peg the place the cemetery is 
actually located on Hillsgate Drive past Dunloe Drive in the woods behind and 
between the fourth and fifth house past Hillsgate Drive on the left. Don't 
access the cemetery there and disturb the neighbors though, but there is nothing 
wrong with driving by to spot the cemetery before access from the south at the 
west end of Dunloe Drive. In the winter it can be faintly seen from there. <br>

Notice the yellow pointer indicating the cemetery location in the forest, west of a 
major subdivision, between Pettus Road and Hillsgate Drive, but within 200 yards 
of Hillgate Drive.<br>

This view shows clearly the end of Donloe Drive (unlabeled) on a cul-de-sac 
circle. There is a hedge and across that is a pond, shown in red here. <br>
<img border="0" src="PettusCemAerial2.jpg" width="1021" height="469"><br>
With this exploded view we see the cemetery highlighted in the forest behind the 
nearby houses. Be sure to access this cemetery from the south and not the 
residential homes there as folks there did not bargain for cemetery visitors and 
need their privacy.<br>
