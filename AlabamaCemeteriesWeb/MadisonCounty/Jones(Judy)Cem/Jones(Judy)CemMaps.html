From Huntsville go northeast on Winchester Rd past New Market to Old Mountain 
Fork Rd and turn right. follow that and the road branches. Keep straight ahead 
to continue on Old Mountain Fork Rd vs Mountain Fork Rd. to the left. Go about 300 
yards to the long tree lined thicket on the north (left) side of the road. The 
three stones I found were hard to locate among the brush, but are close to the 
road and in the winter can be seen.<br>

This aerial view shows the patch of woods where the cemetery can be found. As I 
remember the stones were over half way down the long east/west tree lined 
thicket and near the road and the Walker stone was further on toward the east 
end. This plot may 
also have been used as an old slave graveyard (prior to 1865) but was used by 
the Jones Family too. Generally slaves did not mark their graves except for 
using regular field stones.<br>
