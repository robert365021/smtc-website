This topographical map shows the GPS of the Thompson Cemetery of Madison Co. 
Alabama. I think a better GPS location from ACME Mapper is N 34.89196 X W 
86.60147.<br>

2-2S-1W. SW SW NE SW. (Behind the Madison County Co-op in tree thicket on Jack 
Thomas Rd.). Go Pulaski Pike and turn east (right)&nbsp; on Grimwood Rd. After a couple 
miles turn south (right) on Jack Thomas Rd and then left into the road to the Madison 
County Co-op. Arrive at the Co-op and inform them of your visit then walk or 
drive around the outside of the compound fence to the clump of trees in the back 
(south) where you will 
find the cemetery. Keep between the fence and inside the crop line so as not to 
damage anything. This is not a wet weather trip 
unless you have a four wheel drive. </b></font><b>

south of the fence line of the Madison County Co-op.<br>
