Morris Chapel just ain't where it used to be.</span></b></p>

Pleasant Sivley, one of the forefathers of a large Sivley community, came across 
the river from Huntsville and moved into Lawrence County in 1818 (1). He helped 
build the original Morris Chapel Church when his great-granddaughter, Nona 
Sivley McMillan, was only three years old. Mrs. McMillan remembers going to that 
old church. She said Pleasant Sivley preached there at one time.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #993300">Her 
mother and her aunt once told her a tale about the Old Morris Chapel Church, &quot;It 
used to be a large progressive community Methodist church. &quot; Mrs. McMillan said. 
Her mother told her of an old man from Tennessee who lived in the community and 
who did not believe in God. But one night he attended a worship service. That 
was back when churchgoers did a good bit of shouting and singing. Mrs. McMillan 
explained. So when her mother and aunt spotted this man they went up and began 
to talk to him. Soon they began to shout the praises of the Lord to this 
unbeliever. Apparently it was too much for the man from Tennessee, as he jumped 
up and fled through a cornfield to his home and never came back.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #993300">Mrs. 
McMillan said that Joe and John Sivley (2), sons of Pleasant Sivley, were 
prisoners of war in the Civil War and returned to Lawrence County and 
intermarried with Pitts and McCullochs in the Morris Chapel area. </span></b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #993300">Mrs. 
McMillan also, remembers the time they tore the old church down and moved it to 
its present location at the intersection of Old and New Hillsboro Road. The old 
location was northeast of the present site, according to Gertrude Moore, who 
lived a good many of her 90 years in the Morris Chapel community and went to 
church there in both locations. She is not real sure exactly when it was moved, 
but she said she must have been about eight or 10 years old at the time.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #993300">Dr. 
Kermit Pitt also remembers both locations of the Morris Chapel' Church. The 
original site was only three miles away from where he lived and the old Morris 
Chapel cemetery was on land once owned by his great-grandfather. Pitt said the 
church was moved somewhere around the late 1890s. The original church building, 
Pitt remembers, was a farm building, among trees, facing south. It had two doors 
on the south end and a single door on the east side near the pulpit. The pews 
were rough, unpainted wooden benches. There was an organ inside and curtains 
could be drawn, to separate the single room into Sunday school classes.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #993300">H. 
L. Tidwell and Odis Kerby preached there, Pitt remembers. Pitt said there was a 
grammar school on the church grounds with two rooms that taught through the 
sixth grade. People used to have 'dinners on the ground', Pitt said, where 
people brought food and spread it out on blankets on the ground.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #993300">
There weren't many cars in those days and people tied their horses and mules up 
to trees on the church grounds. 'They were good solid folks,&quot; Pitt said. 'They 
raised their families and took them to church.&quot; They were farmers, most of them. 
Mrs. Moore said they raised vegetables, livestock, cotton and corn and hardly 
ever bought anything from a store. 'I haven't 'gotten used to living out of a 
paper sack yet.&quot; she said. She added that everyone loved everybody else and that 
people would travel for miles to help each other out in times of sickness and 
adversity.' I thought it was about the only place to live,&quot; she said. Now, even 
the church building is not the same: Pitt said a newer, nicer building was built 
on the current spot some 30 to 40 years ago. And that building still stands, 
still houses a small congregation of around 25 people.</span></b></p>
