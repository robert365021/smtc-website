The current Morris Chapel Methodist Church is located on Lawrence County Road 
217, at the intersection of County Road 170. It was named for the beloved Rev. 
Moses S. Morris. This church is one of the oldest in Lawrence County, dating 
back to about 1852. <br>
The original church was located about three miles east of the present site near 
Shoals Creek. The flooding of this creek is the reason for the relocation of the 
church.<br>
<br>
Since the exact date of the first building cannot be determined we believe it 
was active in 1852 when the cemetery was started. About 1902 the membership, 
divided east from west by Shoals Creek, decided to physically move to the 
present location. <br>
<br>
In January 1902 J.P. Sivley and wife, Jessie Meadows Sivley, sold to trustees of 
the North Alabama Conference about an acre of land for the nominal sum of $8.00.<br>
<br>
Between 1902 and 1907 the old church was torn down and hauled by wagon and mules 
and rebuilt using the same lumber and stones. The members supplied the labor as 
they found time from their farm chores.<br>
An article appearing in the Moulton Advertiser in 1890 states that Morris Chapel 
was the banner Democratic voting box of Lawrence County. The Democratic 
Executive Committee Chairman, J. P. Elliott was asked to recognize it as such.
<br>
A school building was built about 1910 just north of the church. <br>
<br>
Robert and Molly Pitt Bryant donated one acre and Joe R. and Augusta Sivley 
donated one acre for the school building. The school remained open until 1938.<br>
In 1937 a new church building was erected. The structure was remodeled in the 
1960's. Each year on the 3rd Sunday in May, the church holds an Annual 
Homecoming celebration and decoration when we remember our church founders and 
honor the loved ones <br>
buried there. A small congregation gathers at 10 a.m. each Sunday. We hope one 
day to again be a beacon to the community as this church was over one hundred 
years ago. <br>
