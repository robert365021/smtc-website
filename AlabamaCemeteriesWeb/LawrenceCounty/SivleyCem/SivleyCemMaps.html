This topographical map from Topozone shows the GPS of the Sivley Cemetery. This 
is just south off of Hwy 24.<br>

&nbsp;This road map from MS Streets &amp; trips shows the directions as: From Decatur, 
travel west on Highway 24 for 5.6 miles.&nbsp; After turning right (south) on 
county road 322 and traveling about 1/2 mile, watch for a narrow dirt road on 
the right (west side of the road). The cemetery sits off the road and is 
normally not visible, but there was a sign on the road when I was there, because 
the road also serves residential property in the area.<img border="0" src="SivleyCemeteryAerial.jpg" width="1580" height="577"><br>
The cemetery is seen here with this map as in a clearing under a few trees. It 
is marked with a red check here. The access road is seen as a gray line leading 
west off of CR 322 to the cemetery.<br>
