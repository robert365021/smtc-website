This road map shows the directions: 
Go west from Decatur on Highway 20 toward Muscle Shoals to Hillsboro and turn 
south on County Road 434. Follow that until it crosses the railroad tracks. 
After that turn into the parking space near the tracks and walk south west to 
the cemetery in the middle of a large cultivated field. Currently in Corn. There 
are certain times of the year when the corn is tall you will be unable to visit 
this cemetery due to the high corn. I got lucky and found I was there just after the corn 
harvest.<br>

Notice the cemetery in the midst of a giant (currently harvested) cornfield. 
There are no trees in the cemetery.<br>
