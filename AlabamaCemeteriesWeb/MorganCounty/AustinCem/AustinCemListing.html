<font size="2">This cemetery has a very large open area in 
the front and likely either there are a lot of unmarked graves here or there was a old 
church on the front side of the few remaining grave assets. When I visited this 
cemetery to photograph it in 2003 it was torn up with only one stone standing. I picked up a the 
small stones and reset them. Later the Decatur city took over and graded &amp; mowed the site and added a 
protective fence along with appropriate signage so 
that it looks nice now. I still wonder who will restore the old eloquent Lawson 
Austin monument. All it needs is to level the base and then set/glue the other two 
parts on top that. <br/>
<br/>
Every time I see destruction around a 
cemetery like this near a populated area I think of this scenario  &amp; 
fictitious story.  Some of this may have happened here with the missing tops of 
tombstones: RogueTeen1 says to RogueTeen2 "If you want to be a part of my 
(gang) club you have to do this. Go to that graveyard over there and grab a 
tombstone and take it and dump it into the Tennessee River." RogueTeen1 
then one night at midnight picks up 
RogueTeen2 and they drive over to the 
graveyard. They snatch up the top of a small marker and shove it into their junk 
car. Then they head off to the Tennessee River bridge where they stop and take 
it out and slide it off the edge of the bridge where it plunges into the 
dark river waters below. Back at school the next day they are bragging to all their cronies 
about what 
they did. Some are in awe, others in disgust, but no one rats on them. Now years later these two individuals consciences are haunting them 
for their bad choices, but they cannot correct this mistake. The stone is gone. The challenged one 
then drives to the bridge in his sports car one day after a dark moment in his life, 
gets out of his car and jumps to his 
death below near where the tombstone was thrown many years earlier. Of course 
the moral is - young people keep your conscience clean. Visit graveyards for the 
right reasons. [CWA 28 Jun
