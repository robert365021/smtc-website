This small cemetery&nbsp; contains the worst example of vandalism (in the 
past) I have ever seen. Only one small stone still stands today. Multiple 
fractures of the stones are scattered around the graveyard. This does 
not happen by the forces of nature, but at the hands of bad people with 
destructive minds. It is today (2010) abandoned &amp; grown up in brush  
within 400 yards of a civilization who ignores this vile desecration of their 
ancestor's monuments. So sad, because many folks around there are related to the 
interred here. Places like Hennigan's Grocery store existed for 1/2 a century at the 
intersection of 2nd Street and River Road. C. Wayne Austin 12 Dec 2010.<br>
