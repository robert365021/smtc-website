This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Hennigan Cemetery.&nbsp; ACME Mapper says the coordinates are this:
N 34.78767 W 87.52424<br>
<img border="0" src="Hennig3.gif"><br>
This road map shows the directions as about 8 miles east of Muscle Shoals on
River Road.&nbsp; Take River Road to Ford City and go about 1/2 mile and look 
left (in the wintertime) at the thicket back behind a house about 300 yards.<br>
<img border="0" src="Hennig4.jpg"><br>
Notice the Red Check marking the thicket where the cemetery resides. It is 
completely abandoned and does not appear to have had visitors that were 
interested in its maintaining it in many years.<br>
