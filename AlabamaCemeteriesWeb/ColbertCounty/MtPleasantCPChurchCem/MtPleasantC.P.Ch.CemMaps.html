To 
reach this cemetery go east out 2nd Street past Wise Aluminum to County Line 
Road and turn north (left). Follow that for about a mile and look left at the CP 
Church and the cemetery is just past the church also on the left.<br>

Notice the yellow highlighter marks an area that approximates the cemetery. 
Granted some of that area is too low for a cemetery being in the flood plain of 
McKiernan Creek.<br>

This view from Google has the complete cemetery shown on the side of a slope 
down to McKiernan Creek.<br>
