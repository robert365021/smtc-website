I also believe Eleanor Carpenter Davidson , wife of Obadiah Davidson is buried
here. I have written to Alton Carpenter about any others who may be buried
there that did not show up in Mr. Quillen's survey. Faye Bradford 18 Dec 2010.<br/>

<br/>
This small cemetery  is not well maintained. Tree roots,
livestock &amp; time has desecrated the stones in the past. This listing was
originally completed by Harold Quillen of Florence and updated by Jan Hall and
Faye Bradford &amp; Kent Pettus.  I am told by other sources that the owner of the
property Mr. J.C. Holt is a descendent
of at least some of the interred of this graveyard. CWA. 18 Dec 2010. Revised 19
Dec 2012</font><br/>

<i><br/>
Sources: No known prior publication
existed of this cemetery, except for that of Harold Quillen, deceased, who visited
and worked
up a manuscript of this and many cemeteries in 2003 of Colbert County Alabama.
He donated that to the archives of
Florence Alabama, where it resides today 16 Dec 2010. Added here initially by C. Wayne Austin 16 Dec
2010. Revised 19 Dec 2012 to include the photo #001 thru 008 &amp; 012 by Jan Hall.
and the personal #009, &amp; tombstone #010 photos supplied by Kent Pettus.
Revised listing to add Faye Bradford's family history and comments 17 Dec 2010
(Enoch Carpenter, Abt 1770 - 31 Jul 1824. and Sarah Evans Carpenter, 1774 - 24
Aug 1824, are related to her (Faye Bradford). Enoch was a brother to her 3rd great
grandfather Hensley Carpenter. Family records state only that Enoch and Sarah
were buried in a small cemetery in a field (across the road) close to the old Presb. Church on Old
Brick Rd.) If you have helpful information on this cemetery let Faye know

<i>Thanks to Harold Quillen, Jan Hall, Kent Pettus &amp; Faye
Bradford for their part in presenting this cemetery, though I would like to go
there and dig out the hidden dates of the Marshall H. Barnes. This cemetery is
also presented in Findagrave.com by these same folks, but with a somewhat
different slant. [C.W.A. 20 Dec 2012.]</i></p>
