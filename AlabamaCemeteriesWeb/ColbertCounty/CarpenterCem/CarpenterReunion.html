- ELEANOR CARPENTER DAVIDSON DESCENDANT SPEAKS TO CARPENTER REUNION GROUP -<br>
<br>
James C. (J.C.) Holt, a direct descendant of Eleanor Carpenter Davidson and 
Obediah Davidson, spoke to a gathering of Carpenter and related family members 
who assembled in Old Brick Presbyterian Church at 3 p.m., July 18, 1982. This 
followed the Annual Carpenter and Related Family Reunion at Tuscumbia Spring 
Park. J.C. spoke about the early history of Old Brick and how this history 
relates to our Carpenter family heritage in that area.<br>
Eleanor Carpenter Davidson was a daughter of Enoch and Sarah (Sally) Evans 
Carpenter.<br>
<br>
Following the meeting in the church, the group moved across the highway and 
visited the field cemetery where Enoch Carpenter, Sarah/Sally Evans Carpenter, 
and other members of their family are buried. Following this, J.C. hosted us for 
a brief visit in his home which is located on the same land as the cemetery. The 
idea of the visit to the Old Brick Church and Cemetery originated with Frank 
Masterson Carpenter. Joyce Dawson Mitchell assisted with making the 
arrangements. In addition to J.C. hosting us in the church, we were also hosted 
by church members William Traver Whitlock and Bernice &quot;Pete&quot; Kent. Traver is the 
husband of the late Alla Mae Carpenter Whitlock. Pete is the nephew of James 
Ausie Carpenter's mother, Laura Kent Carpenter. We will all hear more about the 
Old Brick visit in the weeks and months to come.<br>
<br>
Now for the sake of space, here are just some brief notes about our annual 
family reunion at Tuscumbia Spring Park: <br>
<br>
1.We most assuredly missed those who were not present this year.<br>
<br>
2.Among others, direct descendants of these families were present: Jeremiah Hill 
Carpenter, Lycurgus A. Carpenter, Lucinda Carpenter Hatton, John Calvin 
Bradford, Andrew Jackson Kerby, and Rufus Nichols. Of course, there were 
descendants of more families too numerous to list.<br>
<br>
3.Same officers were re-elected for next year. Frank Masterson Carpenter, 
President - Jane Mitchell Carpenter, Vice President (Frank and Jane remain 
co-chairpersons of the annual reunion) - Nancy Carpenter Mitchell, 
Secretary-Treasurer - David Robert Carpenter, Chaplain. All other honorary and 
supporting officers remain for the next year.<br>
<br>
4.We will probably omit a few and know it is dangerous to try to remember 
everyone, but these are a few of those attending the reunion for the first time 
this year: Effie Waldrep Nichols, Betty Beck Nichols , Claudie Bennett Hallmark, 
Robert Hallmark, Emmette Alucian Grissom, Sara Clardy Grissom, James Morrison 
Kerby, Mary Alice Blanchard Kerby, Clyde William Kerby, Mildred Elkins Kerby, 
Thomas Pennington, Barbara Simpson Pennington, and Tharol D. Smith. (I am 
certain there were a number of younger members and children who were there for 
the first time.<br>
I am just as certain that I have missed a few and apologize in advance for doing 
so, J.A.C.). The oldest member present (youngest at heart) was Cousin ,Mattie 
Nichols Butler. <u>Lela Summers Masterson</u> came to the reunion this year!<br>
<br>
In brief summary, despite far too many of our family members not present this 
year, this was one of our best reunions. New members attending, good food and 
fellowship, and the afternoon sessions at Old Brick Church and the Carpenter 
Family Cemetery accounted for this in part. Douglas Robbins, our family 
photographer, will probably have good pictures to share with us. Well! Now for 
next year!!<br>
