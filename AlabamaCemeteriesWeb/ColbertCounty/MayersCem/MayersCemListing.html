<p>This is one of the oldest graveyards in Colbert County Alabama.&nbsp; The 
settlers did not begin to come into Alabama in full force until after about 1814. 
At that time this was a part of the Mississippi Territory and there was only one 
county in this area that of Madison County which covered a large part of North 
Alabama. For a period of time after the settlers arrival no tombstones 
were available for those who died. It was not until about 1818, when tombstones began 
to be widely available for use in marking graves. Even then they were  
expensive and difficult to obtain so that settlers often purchased them only for the 
household head. The exceptions to that were when families became 
prominent &amp; wealthy. The Mayers Family fell into that prominent category I 
am sure.</p>
<p>This cemetery is in bad shape. The inscribed readings were from three old 
fallen box tombs sometimes called table top tombs. The tops were mostly broken, nearly buried 
and had to be dug up and cleaned to get the readings &amp; photos. There was a stone wall 
around the cemetery at one time and it is now fallen. The rocks from 
the wall are comingling with the stones that formerly supported the tops of the 
tombs leaving a disheveled rocky look.</p>
