<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000" size="2">FAIRCLOTH CEMETERY, (River Road east) COLBERT COUNTY, 
ALABAMA<br>

This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Hobgood Cemetery. ACME Mapper 2.0 says these coordinates 
are: N 34.78517 W 87.46073<br>
<img border="0" src="FairclothCemRd.jpg" width="1600" height="807"><br>
To 
reach this cemetery from the intersection of Hwy 133 &amp; River Road go east about 
12 miles and just before you reach Wheeler View Dr. on the left there is a (brushy 
covered) bridge 
across the gulch on the left of the road that goes back into the thicket. Go 
into that and turn right after going over the dirt covered bridge and go out into the open 
field and bend back left &amp; follow the edge of the thicket until you get nearly to the end 
or about 70 yards from the end of 
that. Turn into the thicket again which may be full of saw briars and go to an old fence 
row and 
cross over that without injuring yourself as it is very steep and overgrown here 
so the fence is about 5 feet high. The cemetery is at the base of one of 
the many tall hackberry trees due west of your&nbsp; position here.<br>

Notice the red-check pointer indicating the place in this odd shaped thicket where 
the cemetery exist. If all else fails to find this cemetery go to the corner of 
the old barn still inside the thicket and walk straight out or northeast about 30-40 yards and you should 
see the disheveled &amp; broken stones leaning against and scattered all around a 
Hackberry tree cluster. The cemetery is also about 10 yards on the west side of 
the old hog wire fence that spans this thicket.<br>
