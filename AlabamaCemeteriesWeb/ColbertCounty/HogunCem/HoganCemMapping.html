This Aerial map shows the GPS of
the Hogan/(Hogun) Cemetery. ACME Mapper 2.0 says these coordinates 
are: N 34.69678 W 87.61923<br>

To Reach this cemetery - from the intersection of Highway 72 and 157/20 go east on 157 until you come to 
Gargis Lane. Turn left (or north) and go about 1/4 mile and look 
left at the clump of trees on your left out in the field or subdivision. After another 1/4 mile 
turn left into the new road Cornelius Landing subdivision and then take the first left turn and 
travel until you are nearest the stand of trees. Go into the stand of trees 
where you will find the cemetery. You can see the last series of turns on the 
map below showing the unfinished subdivision. I cannot guarantee this will be 
the correct right of way to this cemetery in the future. This subdivision is 
under development and with houses lining the road it will become difficult to 
get into this cemetery without crossing private and very occupied premises. In 
that case use the field from Gargis Lane.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#008000"><br>

Notice the red check pointer indicating a group of trees under which the 
cemetery exist. Also notice the new streets with unfinished houses on them where 
you will need to negotiate to get to this cemetery in the future unless someone 
takes special efforts to get a reserved right-of-way. <br>
