I was told by E.D. Ford there was an old antebellum house near this graveyard
which was at one time inhabited by the Streater Family.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Ford family who lives nearby has a tradition of maintaining cemeteries in
this area. E.D. informed me he is keeping this cemetery up. There are visible
repairs to the memorials and the grounds inside this corn field. That is now E.D.
Ford. His father is now deceased.
