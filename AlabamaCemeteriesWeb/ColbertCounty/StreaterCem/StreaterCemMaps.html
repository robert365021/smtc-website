The above map 
shows the Approximate GPS location of the Streater Cemetery.

This road map shows the cemetery pointed out with a blue pointer. It is just
back from the road called Sockwell Lane on this map but there is a sign on the
road calling it Mathaler Lane south of Hwy 20/72 Alt. This is just about 3 miles
east of Muscle Shoals Alabama. It is unlisted in MS Streets &amp; Trips so we
pointed it out with a blue arrow. The arrow is actually points about 100 feet to 
the right (east) of the cemetery.<br>

 This aerial view above
shows the cemetery located in a large field about 200 yards from the road upon a 
knoll. The cemetery can be seen from the Road when the crops are harvested. It 
is elevated above the surrounding land somewhat.<br>

This recent Google map shows the cemetery more clearly in the middle of a giant 
field. Here is the best way to find it. Going west on Wheeler Highway just 
before Sockwell Lane on the right (toward Muscle Shoals) Count two houses on 
your right and draw a straight line straight south or left 600 feet or 200 yards 
out into the field and you will locate the cemetery. There is a high bank that 
will obscure your view from this procedure, but it will work if you walk in the 
direction of the line, but not when the farmers crops are present to be trampled 
on.&nbsp; <br>
