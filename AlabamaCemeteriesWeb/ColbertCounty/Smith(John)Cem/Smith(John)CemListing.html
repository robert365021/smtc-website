<p align="center">SMITH (John) 
CEMETERY (Old Hwy 20 east of Leighton Al) COLBERT COUNTY ALABAMA<br>
<br>
<a href="Smith(J)CemMaps.html">Mapping the Location</a></p>
<p><font size="2">Further out Old Hwy 20 sat the old 
home place of Ed Crockett and his ancestors. A beautiful old home was among 
these old trees. Not sure what event destroyed it. Believe this is the same Ed 
Crockett interred in the Old Brick Church Cemetery. There was also a share cropper 
home that was behind that. It was abolished in a tornado killing one occupant in 
the 1950s: <a href="IMG_6936.JPG">6936</a> / <a href="IMG_6937.JPG">6937</a><br>
<br>
A mile down (turn left) Fennel Road finds the original home of 
Jack Johnson, a farm family who lived here in early times. This was next door to 
his son the A. O. Johnson family home now abolished (see Shaw Cemetery -

<p>Dates of birth &amp; death 
from John Smith's Bible Record cited in DAR application #518524 by Mildred 
Fennel Preuit. This application and earlier applications however says he was 
born and served in the Revolution in South Carolina. This has been disapproved 
by many documents. It would therefore appear the Bible did not give the place of 
birth. We now know he was born in Virginia and served in the Revolution there in 
Virginia. [Findagrave.com]<br>
<br>
Alabama History Quarterly, Winter Issue 1944 pg 648-9 &quot;John Smith died 3/18/1841 
at the home of his son, John Smith Jr. at the age of 87. He was in the 
Revolution at its close. He was a member of the Baptist Church at least 52 
years. &quot; Huntsville, AL Advocate 8/29/41. Huntsville Democrat published death 
notice Aug 1841 stating &quot; Departed this life on the 17 Aug. 1841 ...aged near 90 
years...&quot; Diary of E.A. Osborne, Charlotte, NC found in the (NC State Archives 
?) Durham NC. Copy of will of John Smith filed deed Record Vol. 1 pg 66 &amp; 67 
Lawrence Co., AL Showed up in Alabama in 1812. From Osborne Diary &quot;John Smith 
married a Miss Whitehead of VA. In Miss Terr. by 1809 or earlier. Bought land 
(150a) R 1E TWP 2 Sec 10. The 1816 Census of Madison Co. shows heads of 
families: John Smith, Nathan Smith, Iavan McVay (Rhoda Smith's husband and Eli 
Smith (Possible Elias, John's brother.&nbsp; [Findagrave.com]<br>
<br>
His tombstone was placed at the site of the Smith Cemetery in 1976 by the Chief 
Colbert Chapter DAR, Tuscumbia, AL. This cemetery is at the site of his son's, 
John (Pond) Smith Jr.'s, home, which is now in Colbert Co., and is near Leighton 
AL. It has been plowed up, and only one tombstone left in it original position. 
John Sr.'s original tombstone has not been found if there ever was one. <br>
<br>
Because it was impossible to get from the home of John Jr. to Moulton, AL when 
the creeks were up (Town Creek and Big Nance) or when the road up Moulton 
Mountain frozen over in the winter, the area where John Jr. lived was 
transferred from Lawrence Co. to Colbert Co. in 1895 so residents could take 
care of their business in Colbert County.<br>
