BAPT CHURCH CEMETERY, (Mt Pleasant Rd aka Brick Church Rd) , COLBERT
(eastern) COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>
<img border="0" src="HattonBaptChCemTopozon.jpg" width="689" height="579"><br>
This topographical map combined with the TOPOZONE mapping data shows the GPS of
the Hatton Baptist Church Cemetery. It is listed as the Mt Pleasant Cemetery
above which is the old name.<br>
<img border="0" src="HattonBaptChurchCemRd.jpg" width="559" height="259"><br>
Shown here as the Mt Pleasant Cemetery. This road map shows the directions as about 8 miles east of Muscle Shoals on
hwy 184 (2nd St).&nbsp; Take County Road 48 left and go
9/10 of a mile and turn right (or east) onto County Rd 66 (aka Old Brick Rd/Mt
Pleasant Rd.) Go 7/10 of a mile and the cemetery is on your right. This cemetery
is maintained by the Hatton Baptist Church at the intersection of 2nd St and
Hatton School Rd.<br>

Notice the two yellow arrows. Both are pointing at cemeteries. The one on the
left points at the main part of the Hatton Baptist Church Cemetery and the one
on the right points to a smaller group of stones belonging to the old original Mt
Pleasant Church Cemetery, but also maintained as the Hatton Baptist
Church Cemetery. As I understand the history they were all Baptist here
with the Mt Pleasant Baptist Church known to have been here sometime before 1820.<br>
