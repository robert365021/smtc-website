</font>

Amos Jarman founded the old brick
historical Jarman
Plantation home 500 yards across the field south of here sometime earlier than
1820. I am unaware of when he built the current home, but the cotton plantation movement
was booming by 1840. The home was built of bricks using some
of the same techniques used to build the church facility found here at one time. At his passing 
Amos was
laid to rest in this cemetery along with his wife Mary. Later it is known one of 
the sons of the early Streit family that moved here lived in this home and more 
recently the Blythe family lived here. <br>
<br>
Amos Jarman, and (I am sure his wife), also aided in organizing a church here in 
1822 known as the Pond
Creek Baptist Church. Later the name was changed to Mount Pleasant Baptist
Church. At about the same time or earlier the Mt Pleasant (later known as Old Brick) Presbyterian 
Church located just west of here 1/2 mile and 
their church facility was built. When the Presbyterian's wooden building burned 
in 1824 they built a new brick
church building, completing that in 1828 which remains today. The Presbyterians brick building was
patterned after the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church Building once located here. It is
thought the Baptist Church stood about where the new part of the cemetery is now
located in center of which may be a few feet in back of where the photographer 
above is standing. The death year of the oldest known stone in the new section 
of this cemetery is for
Sarah Densmore and that stone is well down the slope leaving plenty of room in
earlier times for the level area needed for a building site, even if it still stood in
1877.&nbsp;All this indicates the building stood near the road where only a few 
new graves are found.<br>
<br>
The Mt Pleasant Baptist Church burned sometime after the Presbyterian
Church was built, and the Baptist Church was relocated to what is today known as Hatton School
Community at the
Junction of Hwy 184 and Hatton School Road. I presume that was when it was 
renamed Hatton Baptist Church after that community name. That is about 2 miles southeast of
this cemetery. Years later the Cemetery was renamed the Hatton Baptist Church
Cemetery to keep the historical connection. Today the cemetery continues to 
be maintained by the Hatton Baptist Church.<br>
<br>
One can view the Old Brick Presbyterian Church facility and see something of how
the Mt Pleasant Baptist Church building looked in its time. I am also aware the
brick on the Jarman House is about the same color as that of Old Brick 
Presbyterian Church
indicating the use of similar local clays. It is known the clays for Old Brick
Presbyterian Church came from the church yard, because a hole was left in the 
ground to remind us of that. [W Austin 10 Dec 2009.]<br>
