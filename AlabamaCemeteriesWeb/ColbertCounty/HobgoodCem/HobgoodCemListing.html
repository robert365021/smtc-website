I kept the spelling of Elledge consistent with two &quot;L&quot;s. These graves were all 
of one family. I do not know for sure which spelling is correct.</p>
<p>I was told by the land owner Mr. James McDowell 
that nearby kids came here and sprayed 
painted these stones with black and green paint. It is now peeling off and looks bad but 
should cause no long term harm. </p>
<p>Buried here are folks with the surnames as I 
found them: (3) Hobgood; (5) Keenum; (3) Hicks; (5) Elledge/(Eledge). There is a 
total of 16 remaining inscribed stones. There were three small stones in the 
Elledge/Keenum area whereby the tops with the inscription were broken off. <br>
<br>
This cemetery is called the Blocker Cemetery on maps. I don't know the source 
for that name so I stayed with the name Hobgood Cemetery following the naming of 
others who have listed this cemetery in the past.<br>
<br>
A nice rock wall once surrounded the Hobgood &amp; Hicks memorials but has fallen 
over in many places. The Keenum &amp; Elledge monuments are outside the wall and 
have been subjected to livestock damage in the past. Also falling trees in the 
past have damaged many of the monuments.<br>
<br>
Mr. James McDowell who owns the surrounding land gave me (C. Wayne Austin) 
permission to visit this cemetery. It will be within 100 yards east of the 
northbound lane of the new 4 lane Wilson Dam Highway #133 when that is 
completed.<br>

existed of this cemetery, except for it may be in the three volume set of books &quot;Old Times in 
Colbert &amp; Lawrence County Alabama&quot; and also that of Harold Quillen, deceased, who visited 
and worked 
up a manuscript of this and many cemeteries in 2003 of Colbert County Alabama. 
He donated that to the archives of 
Florence Alabama, where it resides as of 16 Dec 2010. Added here initially by C. Wayne Austin 
26 Dec 
2012, based on photos dated 22 Dec 2012. This cemetery was unlisted on Findagrave.com until I added the 
3 Hobgood listings [C.W.A. 26 Dec 2012.]</font></i></font></p>
