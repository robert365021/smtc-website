This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Murphy-Kemper-Cockburn Cemetery. ACME MAPPER:

</b><i>That National 
Fertilizer Development Center seen on this map is now closed. It was started as 
a War Gas facility back in the middle 1900s and produced until just after World 
War II. It components were added with that produced across Wilson Dam Rd Hwy 133 at what later would 
become the Diamond Shamrock Chemical Plant/then Occidental, who produced a very 
high grade of Chlorine used in that war gas effort. Many shoals heads of 
household heads found work in the plants located in this area back in the good 
times when TVA reigned as a major employer. Sometime after the war ended this 
facility was retooled as a 
Fertilizer Research Development Center and operated as such for many years before President Ragan 
(I think) closed it.&nbsp; I remember once about 1973 an individual coming from 
Europe to serve as a research scientist at this facility. He was billed out as 
one of Europe's brightest in this field. A couple of years after he started work 
here he was killed in a traffic accident where the Rail Road crosses River Road on the way to his home 
off of 
River road. Sorry I don't remember his name after 40 years, but since his river 
property was near mine I remember his friendly demeanor. <br>
Just to the left on this map and down next to the Tennessee River was at one time 
an old Direct Current Power Plant that was built in the early 1900s to produce 
Electricity. It was mothballed about 1930 to make way for the massive and more efficient 
Alternating Current generating plants. It was called the Alabama Power Plant. 
The buildings and stacks were finally torn down in 1966 and all the old Dynamos (Direct Current generators) were scrapped for the copper &amp; steel content. 
I was the office clerk for the Kaiser Nelson Steel &amp; Salvage Co. a Cleveland 
Ohio based firm that had the demolition contract. The site demolition was 
managed by Mr. Jim Blake of Cleveland, an individual with a lot of self 
confidence. One cold day in January he accidentally stepped on a loose board and 
plunged some 40 feet into an underground hole, down inside the debris of what 
was the demolished 5 story main building. He survived the fall unscathed, and 
even climbed back to the surface unaided. &quot;All he said to me later was I told 
you I was tough. No average man could have survive that fall, much less live to climb 
back out.&quot; Mr. Blake (who was born about 1920) was handicapped in one eye. 
So far as I know not even an accident report was ever filed on that incident. I 
think he was an old athlete who trained as an accountant before landing in the demolition business and 
was just one of many interesting business people over my 40 year business career 
that I crossed paths with. Now back to Cemeteries.</i><b><br>

Notice the Red Check marking the Privy Hedge thicket where the cemetery resides. It is 
completely abandoned and does not appear to have had visitors  
interested in maintaining it in many years. If you go here take a good pair of 
loping shears and prepare for hard work. Also notify T.V.A. Security of your 
intent &amp; visit.<br>
