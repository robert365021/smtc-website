From Muscle Shoals go east on 2nd Street Road for about 10 miles to Underwood 
aka Mitchell 
Cross Roads and turn left (north) on County Line Rd and go a mile or so to the Mt 
Pleasant Road aka Brick Road and turn right (east) and go about 3 tenths of a 
mile to the cemetery on your right under the old Cedars and adjacent to 
the Old Brick Presbyterian Church - one of the oldest in Alabama. <br/>

Old Brick Church Cemetery is shown here on County Road 66 or Mt Pleasant Road. 
We have drawn a yellow outline that approximates the borders of the cemetery. It 
lies to the west of the church and parking lot and extends back south about 400 
feet. A large sink lies just west of the church building where clay was mined 
(see the photos) for 
the bricks to form the church building in abt 1827. That area is both too low 
and historic to use for the cemetery purposes.<br/>
