<p align="center"><b>OLD BRICK CHURCH CEMETERY, (Mt 
Pleasant Road aka Brick Road), COLBERT
(eastern) COUNTY, ALABAMA</b><p class="MsoNormal" align="center">
Mount Pleasant Presbyterian 
Church (Old Brick) community and its descendents.</p>

  <b>Some of these folks interred in this cemetery may have founded the home site where my parents 
  Paul &amp; Ruby Austin built
  in 1964. There was a 100 year old large Cedar tree there and Dad cleared
  around it leaving it standing.&nbsp;It was on its last leg of life and soon 
  died anyway from having been shaded from the giant black oaks hovering over it. We also discovered old Chards of pottery plates
  and&nbsp;glass indicating someone&nbsp;had a home there before we did, but it was
  many years earlier.&nbsp;The trees and growth were at least 30 to 50 years,
  untouched when my Dad and my brothers arrived with our axes and brush cutting
  gear in the late summer of 1963. This place was sitting&nbsp;above the Shegog Creek, a cold water 
  branch which ran thru the
  property below. It was a beautiful place with an ideal building site. Dad wasn't the only
  one to know that. The soil all around there was rich and grew large beautiful
  vegetables and fruits and even the trees grew fast.&nbsp;One could dig a post 
  hole five feet down before the soil became unfertile and the water table was 
  only about 40' from the top of the ground. Paul Austin built a home suitable 
  for his 4 to 5 children remaining at home. That meant a home divided up into many 
  bed rooms (which meant very small quarters for each child by today's' 
  standards), but somehow we survived it without major disruptions.) Very soon 
  Ernie went off to Auburn U. and Warren had earlier moved to West Tennessee to 
  live with Uncle Jim and Aunt Lutie Austin Jones to finish High School &amp; go to 
  trade school there. That relived some of the space issues. </b>
  <p><b>The Oscar Medley family lived across the street from the Old Brick church 
  cemetery. They were members of the Ford City Church of Christ during their 
  time living there. Oscar was a postal worker. They had two children Roy and Nadera. Roy married and later became a home construction manager for a Memphis 
  based company so he moved there and spent several years &amp; and died there. He 
  was buried back in his native Coffee County, Tennessee. Nadera married and 
  moved to Texarkana, Texas. Oscar was the founder of the Jackson Heights 
  subdivision about 1968 in Muscle Shoals so to get that going he purchased the land and subdivided it then built his own home there 
	getting the Jackson family to also build there. He&nbsp; began 
  to sell lots to others among which had been the Jackson family. The 
	subdivision carries the Jackson's name. This was to become the first 
	prominent subdivision of Muscle Shoals, Alabama. By 1968 the Medley's had moved there. 
	Eventually home called to the Oscar and Ernestine Medley family and they 
	sold out and moved back home to their birth place, Manchester Tennessee 
	where they all eventually passed from this life into another. </b>

  <b>Gerber was another prominent family that lived down River Road near Ford City.
  The earliest Gerber can be traced as German immigrants who came to this 
	country in 1874. They were Fred &amp; Mary M. Gerber and were found living in 
	the old Brick community in 1930 census. Their home was believed to 
	be established just back 1/4 mile from Ford City Al where Henry Ford attempted 
	to build a city when the Wilson Dam was built. In the&nbsp; Later generations of Gerber 
	this is across the road (west side) a 1/2 mile
  further north of Shegog Creek toward Ford City.&nbsp;There is an&nbsp;old home there which is barely standing today 
	which was a good home in their day. 
  Fred &amp; Mae J. Gerber were elderly when I was a teenager and&nbsp;they died in 1971 
	&amp; 1966 respectively. One of the daughters
  of Fred married an Austin (no close relation to me, but thought to be from the 
	Austin family of Florence Alabama) and they built a home next door to
  the Gerbers' and all are buried here in close proximity. One Gerber-Austin grandson Fredrick 
	Austin was well thought of in school. He has an older brother named Franklin 
	and a younger brother Robert. Frederic was born&nbsp; about 1946 &amp; went over 
	seas sometime after graduation from Colbert Co. High in 1964. By the 1970s he was known&nbsp;to be handing out 
	Bibles behind the Iron Curtain. As time progressed he was discovered 
	elsewhere in the world in the same mission. Before many years his family 
	ceased to hear from him and knew not what happened to him. I wonder if he 
	met his fate against some of those radical Muslims who have grown to be a 
	major threat to Christianity and world peace today. A big part of them are 
	taught to either convert or kill anyone not of their religion and they are 
	financed with oil money to carry out this ominous mission. However Chinese governments were very intolerant of Christianity.</b><p align="center"><i>Compiled &amp; written by C. Wayne Austin 24 Feb
