<u>Streits' interred up the road east of here in the Hatton Baptist Church Cemetery 
In earlier times this cemetery was known as the Jarman Cemetery. Those earlier 
inhabitants of the Jarmon surname that lie 
here were connected to the founding of the Pond Creek Baptist Church which later 
become the Hatton Baptist Church:<br/>
<br/>
</u>STREIT, Samuel "Sam", 21 Feb 1870 - 20 Aug 1955. (lived in the old 
antebellum house south of Hatton School.  He and his 1st wife's graves are 
a located on Mt Pleasant Road. <br/>
and<br/>
STREIT, Jocey, 8 Nov 1877 - 14 Oct 1918. (1st wife of Wife of Samuel Streit.)<br/>
AUSTIN, Emma Streit, 9 Aug 1899 - 22 Sep 1924.<br/>
STREIT, Louise E., 25 Nov 1911 - 6 Dec 1911. <br/>

<br/>
This family of Streits' came to Colbert County from 
Switzerland in 1882. There was three brothers - Fred, Christian &amp; Samuel. We 
will mention them and some of their offspring here. <br/>
Charlie Streit (not listed above) was married to Dallas Whitlock. He owned &amp; ran 
the milk operation in Sheffield called Streit Milk Company beginning about 1933. 
The milk Plant was probably located 1 block north of Montgomery Ave in 
Sheffield, Alabama. Charlie's wife was also connected to a family who owned a Milk Plant in Decatur. Might this be the one on 6th Ave., 
an operation which now has a very storied 
history and even employed this author in recent time. Charlie was the son of Christian Streit b. 1870 in Switzerland. D. 1951 
east Colbert County Al. buried in the Old Brick Church Cemetery.<br/>
<br/>

The old Jarman House. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">George Streit was the son of Fred Streit and a cousin of Albert who was born in 
1897. George had a farm about where Mr. Frank Whitlock the Barber lived in more 
recent times. That is 
about where Shegog Creek crosses under Mt Pleasant Road today, but on the south side 
of the road.<br/>
<br/>
Fred Streit b. 1865 later owned the large two-story brick 
house built by Amos Jarman (1789-1861), in the 1820s. Jarman was a wealthy land 
owner who settled here about 1820. The house has beautiful mantels and woodwork 
throughout. Jarman and his wife Mary were both natives of North Carolina. In 
1822 Jarman assisted in organizing Pond Creek Baptist Church (north of his home on Mt 
Pleasant Road) near his plantation, the church was later known as Mt Pleasant, 
but it no longer exists. See that history under Hatton Baptist Church. The Jarman farm became the Fred Streit family farm. In 
1942 Mr. and Mrs. Delony B. Blythe inherited the home from the Streit heirs and 
have done a remarkable job in restoring and maintaining this property thru the 
generations and years.<br/>
<br/>
Christian Streit b. 1865 Switzerland, founded a farm between Hatton School and 
Underwood aka Mitchell Cross roads on the north side of the 
road. It was or at least became a single story white framed home with prominent red brick 
columns supporting the porch east side of the home. The home was later owned by 
a son David.
David Streit was the brother of Albert b. 1897. David &amp; Mildred Lee inherited or 
bought the farm from his father Christian Streit. The driveway of this place sloped gradually up the hill for 
350 yards to the 
house leaving the place always prominently visible &amp; well maintained from second street as one 
drove by. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/ColbertCounty/OldBrickChurchCem/Old_Br6.jpg"/><br/>
The Christian and later David Streit farm in more recent times</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Albert &amp; Eileen Streit lived also on the north side of Second Street 
further to the west about a 1/2 mile from David, but in a home built after 1940, 
and near the road. Eileen (pronounced I' leen') was a 2d grade Teacher at Hatton Elementary School 
when I was there. She &amp; Mrs Gammill stirred the musical talents of all thier students with 
songs &amp; musical endeavors of all kinds. Mrs Gammill ordered the whole class flutes at 
one time and taught them all to play that instrument in unison &amp; harmony.

<br/>
<br/>
Sam Streit came into possession of 
the old Stanley antebellum home &amp; farm. It is believed he turned the farm into a 
large dairy operation at some point. There are large barns on the premises which still stand 
today. This massive old historic home that dates to about 1840 was located south of Hatton School.  
Sam and 
his 1st wife's Jocey are interred in the Hatton Baptist Church Cemetery on Mt 
Pleasant Road 3 miles from this place, but Sam's second wife is believed by me 
to have been Annie Reichart-Burger, 1877 - 1936 interred here in Old Brick 
cemetery. She brought step-children into Sam 
Streit's family.</p>

antebellum home south of Little Hatton.<br/>
<br/>
Herman Streit 1911-1978 (s/o Sam &amp; Jocey Streit) &amp; his wife 
Louise lived south of Hatton School about 1 mile on the east side of the road across 
from the old Antebellum home where it is believed Sam Streit lived in earlier 
times. He drove the 
school bus for a time and in later Herman and Louise owned and operated Streit's Store at Little Hatton for several years. The store was later sold to one 
of the Austin's who lived nearby who operated it as Austin's Grocery.<br/>

Herman &amp; Louise Streit home. (Herman was my bus driver when I was a child 
for a while, but so was Johny Streit for a time.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There was a family with last name of Burger; that lived in the area 
probably in the what would become the old 50 acre Austin farm home south of Hatton School &amp; 
near where the Sam &amp; Herman Streit homes &amp; farms were 
located. They had three children, two boys and girl. The girl was 
in my (Albert) class at Colbert Co. Hi School. One boy was older and one younger than me. 
I was told that these were my cousins. My sister, whom I asked about the Burgers' 
said they moved to Birmingham, Alabama. I don't remember the parents. (Albert Streit 2010.) Commentary. The 
later Burger family were the step children 
of Sam Streit and the children of Annie Burger Streit who married Sam after 
Sam's first wife died.</p>

<u>Oleham's in Mt Pleasant Cumberland Presbyterian Church Cemetery.</u><br/>
OLEHAM, Edythe Virginia, b. Nov. 8, 1922 - unknown (unmarried, 
daughter, after her parents died she finished college (UNA) and taught at Hatton 
School Elementary for a time.)<br/>
OLEHAM, James Anthony "Tony", Dec. 3, 1958 - Apr. 21, 1994 (I believe

adopted son)<br/>
OLEHAM, Thomas A, Nov. 3, 1900 - Apr. 25, 1968, (Father of George, Virgil, 
Marshall &amp; Virginia, Husband of Kate. Life was hard for him after he lost 
his wife as they were a farm family and all hands were needed. Today their two 
story beautiful old white frame house no longer stands. It stood majestically 
for at least a 100 years about 400 yards south of Hatton 
School on Hatton School Road on the west side &amp; very near the road.)<br/>
OLEHAM, Katie, Jul. 14, 1902 - Mar. 1, 1966 (wife of Thomas A. Oleham. She was 
killed by a road construction grader, in a freak accident which took place while walking 
to the Streits store to purchase groceries; Tom never got over that and 
eventually took his life a couple of years after the accident.)<br/>
OLEHAM, Virgil G., Apr. 19, 1921 - Aug. 1, 2000 (son of Tom &amp; Kate Oleham and 
husband of Mary Peden Oleham. Served many years in the Alabama National Guard in
