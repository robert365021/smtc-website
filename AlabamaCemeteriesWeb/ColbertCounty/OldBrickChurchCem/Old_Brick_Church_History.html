<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">History of Mount Pleasant Presbyterian 
Church (Old Brick)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A traveling preacher named Carson P. Reed came through and 
held a two week Revival. Several people were baptized. Rev. Reed told the people 
if they would build them a Church he would come back and be their preacher. So 
the people began cutting wood, etc. Jan. 1, 1820 was the date set to have 
everything ready. By the end of Sept. 1820 the log church was completed. Rev. 
Carson Reed kept his promise and came back on Oct 8, 1820 and helped to 
establish the church.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1824 the Church caught fire and burned to the ground. 
The next day the people chose a spot 300 feet from the old church spot and 
decided this new church they would build would not be wood but be built of 
brick, stone, and mortar so it couldn't burn down. Everyone dug clay from the 
earth to make the brick and the stones. The slaves were to sun bake the bricks 
for inside walls and a bed of hot coals of fire baked the bricks for outside 
walls. They had to keep the fires going all night. They did a great job. The 
brick are still solid today. They plastered the inside walls; the roof was hand 
hewn shingles that lasted over 75 years. The pews were handmade; they were 
divided down the center. The men sat on one side - the ladies on the other. At 
the back of the church is a balcony or slave gallery where the slaves sat. They 
say one can see even today the spots on the balcony where the children placed 
their heads on the backside of the wall and left greasy places which solidify 
after many years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Church was finished and dedicated on Oct 8, 1828. Rev. 
Carson P. Reed the pastor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the Civil War the slaves were free, so the white 
people built the slaves a church of their own. A few old slaves, remained with 
their masters until they died.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Church was a strong ruling factor in the Community 
since the Courthouse for them at that time was in Moulton. As most other 
churches in those days, they had rules such as no swearing, dancing, lottery, 
drinking, and they could not work their slaves on Sunday. If someone violated 
these rules, they would be tried before the session. There were various ones 
found guilty of wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first session book starts at 1828. Early Pastors of the 
Church were:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carson Reed, T. B. Wilson, W.M. Reed, McMahan, Kinnard, 
Motheral, Jas. Wallis, D. S. Cosby, Baldridge, Orman, C.B. Sanders (sleeping 
preacher), McMan; C.N. Wood, W.C. Beaver and others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were no meetings during the Civil War due to not 
enough elders being at home out of the Confederate Service to form sessions. The Church 
was used for headquarters for General Hood.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Gillian who had helped to build the Church died one 
month after the Church Services started in the new building. He became the first 
known person to be buried in the cemetery and molders there under an old box 
tomb.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Up until the 1900's the original wide board floors were used. A 
new floor, a Fellowship Hall. a Manse (Preachers house) was then built. The members 
put on a new roof, 10 stained glass windows and curtains in the slave 
gallery. The name of the Church was changed from Mounts Pleasant to Old Brick to 
stand out from having the Mt Pleasant Cumberland Presbyterian Church down the 
road from the Mt Pleasant Presbyterian Church.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During the Presbyterian breakaway movement some of the 
members pulled out and moved up the road west of here to the junction of County 
Line Road and Mt Pleasant Road to start meeting there and add that 
building. They went by the name of Mount Pleasant Cumberland Presbyterian 
Church and are still an active congregation today (15 Feb 2011). They 
established a graveyard for their use on nearby grounds.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is a copy of the membership list available 
composed of the 
original handwriting from the Church records. This information was given to 
Joyce D. Mitchell from Mr. Norman Summers and is not furnished here.</p>

  Some of the folks interred here founded the home site where my 
  (C Wayne Austin's) parents built
  in 1964 just back from Shegog Creek on the east side of County Line Road. There was an old 200 year 
  old Cedar tree there at the time. Dad (Paul Austin) cleared
  around it and left it standing.&nbsp;We discovered old chards of pottery plates
  and&nbsp;glass indicating someone&nbsp;had a home there long before we did. It 
  was thought to be
  many years earlier because the trees and growth were at least 30 to 50 years,
  untouched when my Dad and my brothers &amp; I arrived with our axes and brush cutting
  gear in 1963. This building site was sitting&nbsp;above &amp; to the south of the Shegog Creek running thru the
  property below the hill. It was a beautiful place and ideal building site and Dad wasn't the only
  one to realize that in time past. The soil all around there was rich and grew large beautiful
  &amp; lush garden vegetables and fruits.

  Later (1930s-1940s) generations of Gerber's lived across the road (west side) 
  and a 1/2 mile
  further north.&nbsp;There was an&nbsp;old home there is barely standing today.
  There were no boy children from that family. The Gerber folks were old when
  I was a child and&nbsp;they died in 1966 &amp; 1971. One of the daughters
  married an Austin (no close relation to me) and they built a home next door to
  the Gerber's and are interred in this cemetery along with that family of Austins'.

  The Buell family spring up on the west side of County Line Road and thrived 
  for more than a century as Mrs. Mary Buell lived more than a hundred years on 
  this green earth and passed in 1985.<p>Another family the Streits' 
  were connected to the Buells' thru marriage. the Streits' were very prominent 
  folks who moved into this area sometime around 1888. They had immigrated from 
  Switzerland in 1882.&nbsp;The streit brothers bought land and became 
  successful farmers even without the use of slave labor which had allowed many 
  plantation owners prior to the Civil War to become wealthy.
