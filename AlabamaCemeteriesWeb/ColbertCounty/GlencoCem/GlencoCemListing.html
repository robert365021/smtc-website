<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Since I have not been here I cannot say that all the gravestones have been 
accounted for and listed above. From the Aerial view it appears to me to be 
several box tombs but only two have been listed above. It is my opinion that some of 
the box tombs were ignored because 
they were hard or no longer readabler which is common. <a href="IMAG0063-.JPG">0063</a> /

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Listed 
by Harold Quillen 22 May 2005 in his manuscript collection located in the 
Florence, Lauderdale Co Al Archives. This is added here in his memory for the 
work he did but left incomplete.</i><i> Added here by C. Wayne Austin 
29 Dec 
2012, based on the photos &amp; transcription 2003 by Harold Quillen who walked many 
of the cemeteries of Colbert County in an attempt to find and catalogue them all. 
He left the 
work unfinished when he met an untimely death related to an Auto accident. This cemetery 
is also listed on Findagrave.com 
with an incomplete listing as of now. I noticed there is a date of 1 Jan 1998 on 
Harold's photos. He may have been using a film camera and used a copier to make 
his manuscript otherwise he may have failed to set the date on his digital 
camera to 2003 when he surveyed this cemetery. From the lack of clarity the 
photos appear to have been film camera and then copied with a color copier.<br>
