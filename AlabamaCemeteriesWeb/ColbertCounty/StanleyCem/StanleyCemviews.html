CEMETERY, (Hatton School Road, west of abt 700 yards in a grove of trees) , COLBERT
(eastern) COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>

This photo was made while standing on the bank of Jarman Lane to give you a
perspective of where this cemetery is located. We are looking north across a
wheat field at the Stanley Cemetery nestled about 50 yards into the grove of
trees under the little black arrow. That is a distance about 500 yards away.
This photo was made by combining four different photos.<br>

The stones can be found under the trunk of the large Oak tree, but actually just
east (the other side) of that tree. That tree should be there another 100 years. This tree can be spotted in the
1st above photo as a towering brown leaf tree in the distance just to the right of the black
arrow.<br>

The Ellen &amp; Maria L. Stanley memorials are propped against the tree &amp; can
be seen here. Also seen are the short memorials of John W. &amp; Andrew H. Stanley.
These are
visible while more stones are scattered to our right.<br>

The stones of William J. Stanley on out left leaning against the tree with the
military marker of Edward R. Stanley and the fallen stones of Emma I &amp; Maria
E. Stanley sit between us and the headstone of Edward R. Stanley. The Ellen and
Maria L Stanley memorials are left of this photo also propped against a tree.<br>
The Whitlock children memorials are 20 yards strait in back of us into thicker
vegetation.<br>
