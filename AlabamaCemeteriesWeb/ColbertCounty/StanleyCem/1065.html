STANLEY, William J., 21 Jun 1850 - 30 May 1872. &quot;Son of A.J. &amp; E.E.
Stanley.&quot;<br>
</b>This stone was propped against the tree as a way to get it off of the
ground. Being constantly damp will destroy the density of the stone and also
cause it to be lost by sinking below the debris. It is misplaced, but nearby to
the foot of the grave.
