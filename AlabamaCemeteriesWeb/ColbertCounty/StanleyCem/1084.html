<p align="center"><b>STANLEY
CEMETERY, (Hatton School Road, west of abt 700 yards in a grove of trees) , COLBERT
(eastern) COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>

On the back side of that tree and also leaning also against the tree barely
visible here resides the broken stone of
Ellen Stanley wife of Nathaniel Stanley. We can also see here the stone of Maria
L. Stanley wife of Joseph H. Stanley on the left. I wonder if on the right is
the base part of the Nathaniel Stanley memorial who is the husband of Ellen Stanley. Nathan
&amp; Ellen Stanley are the original Stanley progenitors of
this family. It is Nathaniel &amp; Ellen Stanley who likely came here first.
However, since the stone without inscription is also in the vicinity of Maria
L.'s memorial it might be the base of her husband's memorial who was Joseph H.
Stanley.<br>

This fracture offers detail of the missing bottom part of the death date that is
broken off of the stone. I can clearly see from the contours of the letters June. Also 28 is
visible, 1843 as clear as if it were all there. How certain am I. At least 99.9%.
All of these stones have been broken off since the 1950s when I lived nearby (800
yards south east) to this cemetery. I came thru here while hunting many times as a boy. I don't
recall any broken stones in those days. Biggest enemy lost cemeteries have is trees and limbs falling
on them from storms. Second is vandals. Also just the expansion and contraction
of stone in wet and cold weather can cause fractures. The above break was clean
and may have been from a tree or limb falling or a cow pushing on the stone.
Nevertheless the bottom part can be found nearby somewhere. Epoxy glue
applied to this part and added back on the base would yield a standing stone
again with some effort.&nbsp;<br>
