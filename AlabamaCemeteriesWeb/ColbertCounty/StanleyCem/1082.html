<p align="center"><b>STANLEY
CEMETERY, (Hatton School Road, west of abt 700 yards in a grove of trees) , COLBERT
(eastern) COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>

Here we see the broken stone of Maria L. Stanley wife of Joseph H. &amp; on the
right the memorial of Ellen Stanley one of the original Stanley (mother) progenitors
of this area. The flat base of a tombstone lying on the right side of the Maria
L. memorial is wider than either Ellens' or Marias' memorial. It therefore
belongs to another memorial. It likely belongs to Nathan (husband of Ellen) or
Joseph H. (husband of Maria L.). There is no inscription on that piece
anywhere.&nbsp;<br>

This broken piece offered clues as to the death date broken off and unreadable. We
can make out the word died. The top of a three (or maybe a 2) in the month and
the 8 in 18xx is visible and from the slanted top of the fracture I believe I
can make out a 7 or the top of a nine. If so this is: 3x (or 13) 187X (or
189X). All of these stones have been fractured since the 1950s when I lived
nearby (800 yards south east) to this cemetery and visited it as a boy hunting
around here. I don't recall any broken stones in those days. Biggest enemy is
trees and limbs falling on them from storms. Second is vandals. Also just the
expansion and contraction of stone in wet and cold weather causes fractures. The
above break was from a very violet event as the breaks are not clean and the
broken parts are many.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
