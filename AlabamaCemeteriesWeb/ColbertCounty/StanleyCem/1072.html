</b>We are focusing on a stone in three Whitlock children memorials. They are
difficult to see, being soiled. All of them are broken off except the one on the
far end, away from us. I sat them back
on the lower half long enough to make the photographs and then put them safely
back against the bases to keep them from falling and fracturing further. I had
no epoxy to repair them.<b><br>
