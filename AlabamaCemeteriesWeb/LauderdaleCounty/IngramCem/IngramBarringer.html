INGRAM-THORNTON (2-3/4 miles west of Rogersville just off of Hwy 72), LAUDERDALE COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>
<br>
Barringer, Ernest M., Apr. 18, 1923 - Oct. 5, 1994, Elgin, Lauderdale County, 
Alabama. He&nbsp; and his wife lived on the (north) left side of Hwy 72 in 
Rogersville next to the Church of Christ.<br>
<br>
A testimonial by a former Co-worker:<br>
<br>
Ernie spent his work life as an Accountant for Diamond Shamrock Chemical Company 
of Muscle Shoals Alabama. He was very influential among local plant &amp; corporate 
management, with a knack for facts &amp; figures and how they related to the 
business. Many times during the 1970s where I served as his peer, he was found 
clarifying &amp; persuading management with his simple, clear &amp; effective way of 
looking at the complex issues of the financial and cost of chemical production. 
In my 40 years of accounting experience I have always rated him at the top in 
the field among manufacturing accounting personnel and I worked with several 
hundred Accountants including at least four that passed the CPA exam on the 
first try. In spite of the fact Ernie did not have considerable higher education 
in accounting he had a rare &amp; convincing gift among managerial peers. Also his 
family I must add included a good reputation in the community of Rogersville &amp; 
Elgin, Al where he lived.<br>
