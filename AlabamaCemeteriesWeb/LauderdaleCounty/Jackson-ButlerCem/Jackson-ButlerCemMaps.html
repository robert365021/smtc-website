JACKSON-BUTLER

This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Jackson-Butler Cemetery.<br>

&nbsp;At the 
intersection of Hwy 72 at Elgin Cross Road turn south on Wheeler Dam Road and go 
about 1 mile and turn left (east) into the modular (trailer) house park. Go to 
the back of that and with permission cross out into the field and into the 
cemetery. Do not harm the cattle or cemetery fences getting into this cemetery. 
Use ladders and/or the gates. A better way is to go further south and take 
County Road 84 until you are east of the cemetery and get permission there at 
the house which owns the property and from there you will have a way not to 
cross fences because you will use the gates to get into the cemetery. It 
is possible in my mind labeling this cemetery Belew Cemetery could be in error, 
but if that is the case it is an error in the United States Geological Survey 
Records.<br>

Notice the red check indicating the cemetery location. Permission should be sought from the nearby owners of the property east of there.<br>

This map shows the cemetery shape. The pot handle shape is part of the access 
gate from the east side. I do not believe there are graves there. <br>
