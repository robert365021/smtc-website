COLONEL ANDREW JACKSON COFFEE - A tribute<br>
<br>
</b>
Colonel Andrew Jackson Coffee, born 20 August 1819 near Nashville: died 
Wednesday. (N. B.--place of death not given in this account, but possibly in<br>
California.) He entered West Point as a cadet in 1837 where he remained several 
years, resigning to become a civil engineer,&nbsp; with which<br>
he alternated with being a cotton planter until 1846 when he was appointed 
paymaster in the army and assigned to duty on Gen. Taylor's staff<br>
in the field, serving during the Mexican War up to the Battle of Buena Vista. 23 
Feb. 1847, where his actions were so conspicuous as to win<br>
him promotion from major to Lieutenant-Colonel. General Taylor selected him to 
bear message to President Polk, going over the battle-<br>
field with him before his departure, pointing out and describing various 
positions; he stayed in the army and in 1853 was assigned to duty<br>
&quot;in this city&quot; July 1859. At one time with Col. John Hayes and several others 
owned nearly the whole site of Oakland. California. but<br>
he lost the property.<br>
<br>
His paternal grandfather was Joshua Coffee, who served in the Revolutionary 
Army, and his father was General John Coffee, a distinguished soldier<br>
of the War of 1812, and General Jackson's most trusted friend and lieutenant.<br>
<br>
General Jackson selected General John Coffee to make the night attack on the 
British soon after they landed, which resulted in the memorable<br>
hand-to-hand combat on the night of 23 Dec 1814 with the Tennesseans using their 
hunting knives, as they had no bayonets.<br>
His mother was Miss Mary Donelson, whose family&nbsp; bore a prominent role in 
the history of Tennessee. Her aunt Rachel Donelson was the<br>
wife of General Andrew Jackson. General Jackson &amp; Rachel made their home at the 
Hermitage near Nashville Tennessee when he or she were not serving in other 
places such as in presidential mansions in Washington D.C.<br>
<br>
On his death, General Jackson bequeathed the sword presented to him by citizens 
of New Orleans to Colonel Andrew J. Coffee. Unfortunately,<br>
it was accidently destroyed by fire during the Civil War, while in possession of 
Colonel Andrew Coffee's mother near Florence, Alabama.<br>
<br>
Colonel Andrew Coffee married 3 April 1839 to Miss Elizabeth A. Hutchings of 
Huntsville, Alabama. He took no active part on either side during the<br>
Civil War, but had he entered the Confederate Army a brigadier general 
commission would have been offered him. (Florence, Ala., Times,<br>
18 April 1891.) (N. B.ï¿½The blade of the sword presented to General Jackson by 
the citizens of New Orleans and bequeathed to Colonel<br>
Andrew Jackson Coffee was presented to the Hermitage. near Nashville, Tennessee, 
by Alexander D. Coffee and is displayed there.)<br>

<i>I did </i>

<i>not find his grave stone in this cemetery nor that of his wife.. From the 
above reading, it seems they migrated to somewhere else and&nbsp; are buried 
there.&nbsp; If it was as stated above in Oakland California, perhaps some day 
their gravestones will show up in a local cemetery on findagrave.com assuming 
earth quakes&nbsp; &amp;/or time do not destroy the tombs before someone photographs 
them. <br>
