At the Junction of Browns Ferry Road and Gray Road a distance of 318 Yards east 
of Gray Road and .363 Miles north of Browns Ferry Road near a newly cut 
subdivision road which means this cemetery will be in back of a house before 
long.<br>

From Athens go west to French's Mill and turn south (right) on Mooresville Road (Hwy 
71). Go all the way to Browns Ferry Road and turn left (east) and go a 1/2 mile 
to Gray Road and turn north (left) and go .4 miles&nbsp; and turn into a new 
subdivision road yet unnamed. Follow that for 325 yards and the cemetery will be 
on the left a few yards out in a field upon a knoll. It may presently be behind 
a new house. This may force you to come in via also private property from Gray 
Road walking due east the 325 yards if the houses are such that one would have 
to cross a yard.<br>

This aerial view shows the cemetery inside a clump of brushy trees north of 
Browns-Ferry Road and likewise east of Gray Road. It is inside a privy hedge 
thicket under trees which were falling down on the tombs. I cut some of the dead 
limbs and other brush, but it will grow right back up if we continue to have wet 
summers. Someone recently planted ornamental shrubbery around the premises of 
the tree thicket and a stand of pines were growing there also.<br>
