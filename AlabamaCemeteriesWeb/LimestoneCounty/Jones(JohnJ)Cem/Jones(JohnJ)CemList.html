JONES, J. W., no dates appears to be a child from the 
length of the grave cradle. Only a footstone exist:

<p>Unknown (adult?) base - headstone broken off: <a href="IMG_6490.JPG">6490</a>/<a href="IMG_6502.JPG">6502</a>/<a href="IMG_6501.JPG">6501</a><br>
<br>
<font size="2">The organization of this graveyard is hard to understand with all 
the broken stones, missing stone parts and two remaining footstones with the same initials J.W.J. There is an unknown headstone base in the far southern side of the front 
row of graves and it has no visible footstone.&nbsp;
There is a footstone with initials J.W.J. that probably matches up to a small 
broken (headstone?) base in the second row east behind the footstone M.E.J. The 
base for the small J.W.J. is missing a mid section so it cannot be matched up to 
the small broken base further east. This is probably the base for the 
footstone J.W.J.. This (initials J.W.J.) appears to be a child's grave, but it 
has no visible headstone.&nbsp; <br>
The Mary E. Jones stone does match up to its broken footstone forming the proper 
grave cradle (headstone west - grave - footstone east). However there is a 
missing mid-section of the footstone. The broken John W. Jones headstone was 
lying near the base of a tree next to the other footstone J.W.J but there did 
not appear to be a grave there. I relocated it at the head of an adult grave 
J.W.J. footstone which matched the 2nd footstone J.W.J. This is the only 
standing complete footstone and its initials are as mentioned J.W.J., but it was without 
the headstone. I probed and found as many the broken parts as I could find and 
put it on the head of the grave just south of baby Mary E. Jones to form a grave 
cradle there. Of course that left us with a broken headstone base (next grave 
south) with nothing else found. Most all these graves were covered to some 
degree in old brick making it hard to probe for lost stones under the soil. All 
in all there are perhaps stones or parts of stone for as many as four graves, 
but we only we have two inscribed stones. Of 
course this makes no accountability for unmarked graves which is difficult to 
asses here because of being in a dense thicket which I only partially cleared.<br>
