NELSON CEMETERY, (Buck Island Rd/Nelson Rd.), LIMESTONE COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>
<img border="0" src="NelsonCemTopo.jpg" width="705" height="543"><br>
With this map we see the GPS coordinates also known as the Longitude and 
Latitude of the Nelson Cemetery.<br>
<img border="0" src="NelsonCemRd.jpg" width="999" height="630"><br>
Find this cemetery by following the Buck Island Road out of Athens to Section 
Line Rd. Turn right (east) there and then left (or north)&nbsp; on Nelson Road. 
Nelson Road bends back east so follow that until the road bends back north and 
the cemetery is on the left before the northward bend. The cemetery is 
maintained inside a chain link fence with a sign and evidence it is open to the 
public. Parking is scarce though. <br>

With this map a check is plotted in red and we see the cemetery sitting in the 
bend in the road on the north side of Nelson Road.<br>
