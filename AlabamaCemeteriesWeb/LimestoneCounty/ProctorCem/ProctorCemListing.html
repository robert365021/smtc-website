photography of C. Wayne Austin, 25 Jun 2014. Uploaded here by the same on 18 Dec 
2014. It was also presented in the book Tombstone Inscriptions of Limestone 
County Alabama by Linda H. Smith surveyed 3 Sep 1991 (she did not visit the 
cemetery) on page 412, but the information 
was largely from a listing given to me by Mr. Goode the property owner who takes 
an interest in this cemetery on his property to see that the history is 
preserved. He presented to me copies of the below documents which I converted to 
text.</i></b></p>

Limestone &amp; Meigs &amp; other places in Georgia.</u></b></p>
<p align="left"><u><b>Dr. James W. 
Proctor (Rion Proctor of Meigs Georgia's Grandfather.)</b></u></p>
<p align="left"><b>Dr J.W. Proctor was 
born Dec 5, 1833 in Taliaferro Co. Ga.. In 1858 he joined the M.E. Church South, 
of which he was ever afterward a faithful member. In 1868 he removed to 
Limestone Co. Alabama where he died April 12, 1877. As a physician and Christian 
gentleman, he was highly esteemed by all who knew him. He had a large practice 
to which he devoted much time. Regardless of his own rapidly failing health, and 
contrary to the protests of his friends, his great heart's sympathy for 
suffering humanity supported by an iron will led him as a ministering angel to 
the homes of sorrow. The wintry nights were never too cold and dark for him to 
answer the summons of the poorest cottager. as well as the call of the great. At 
times, during his illness which lasted about six months, he suffered most 
excruciatingly, but never forgot his sick poor, but often expressed a wish to be 
able to visit them. In his death the community has lost one of the most useful 
men. In church a faithful steward, his wife lost a devoted husband, and his 
children a loving father. Lost! No; but heaven shines with brighter luster to 
lure us on to meet him in the home of the blest. Many hearts sympathize with his 
bereaved family</b></p>

<br>
Dear Terry,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and help in locating the Proctor Family Cemetery. It was 
a moving experience for us.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>You helped Rion achieve his goal of finding 
his grandparents' grave. Your nephew and Mrs. McCormick were friendly and 
helpful, too.<br>
<br>
Your mother is very attractive. She and her clients gave such good directions to 
the courthouse that we had no trouble<br>
finding it. We found deed records at the probate judge's office which we copied. 
In the archives room of the courthouse<br>
annex, where records prior to 1900 are kept, we found more than we had time to 
read and copy. We copied census<br>
records for 1870 and 1880, Dr. Proctor's will, and newspaper items of deaths. 
The one about Dr. Proctor's death said he<br>
was to be buried near where he lived by the Masonic fraternity. Could that have 
been the building used as a confederate hospital where he practiced?<br>
<br>
When we left the annex the timing was about right for us to have gone to your 
house to see your father, but Rion was too tired. He in 85 years old. <br>
I am 66, and disappointed that we didn't get to meet and talk with Mr. Goode. 
Maybe the information I am enclosing will tell him part of what he <br>
wants to know. I am, also, sending some pictures I thought you might like to 
have. Those of the graves are pretty good,&nbsp; but not clear enough to read<br>
much on the tombstones. I will be glad to send you prints of them if you would 
like. I am sending information on the graves.<br>
<br>
You mentioned that you would like to clean up the cemetery. Evidently Rion and I 
were so enraptured with the experience we were having we didn't<br>
think to hire you on the spot. We have talked it over and would like for you to 
do it for us at your convenience. If you will accept the job, we will gladly<br>
send you a check for the expense and your time. Just keep a record of what you 
spend, the number of man-hours, and the cost per hour. <br>
We would like it cleared and the fence and gate restored. You can write or call 
collect to give us your answer. Our telephone&nbsp; number is (912) 683-3168.
<br>
<br>
I apologize for the delay in writing to thank you, but twenty minutes after we 
returned from visiting our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren<br>
in Nashville for the weekend Rion's sister called from Milton, Florida. She and 
her son in Pensacola, his wife, and son were coming on Friday and stay until<br>
Saturday. That was Rion's nephew who wanted to go to Athens and see the cemetery 
when we did. He brought the genealogy records he has. We think we<br>
found out whose tombstone Heather found that had only initials on it. I am 
sending you copies of some of the information he and I have that may answer<br>
some of the questions your family may have about the Proctors who once owned 
your farm. May your dream of someday owning all the former Proctor<br>
acres come true. <br>
Please forgive me if I am burdening you with things in which you have no 
interest. <br>
<br>
Please tell your family, Matthew, and Trey &quot;Hello&quot; for us. You folks, Mrs. 
McCormick, and everyone we encountered in Athens were very friendly, helpful,
<br>
and cooperative. We treasure the experience. <br>
Good luck in college and getting a job! We look forward to hearing from you. <br>
