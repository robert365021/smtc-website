From Athens go out Hwy 127 (Jefferson St.) going north and cross the Elk River 
and turn left on Leggtown Rd and travel that for about 2 miles and look left at 
a gate and field road going along the left side of the forest. With permission go 
into that and follow the field road west and you will see the cemetery up under the 
trees inside deep inside the forest on your right. There was a restored log cabin on the east 
side of the cemetery when I was there. <br>

This aerial view shows the cemetery inside a forest on the west side of Upper 
Bethel Road. The cemetery was maintained when I was there.<br>
