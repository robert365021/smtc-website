<br>
A portion of the cemetery is fenced and has been used 
to burn trash in the past.</i><i> One stone was buried. 
(Linda Smith's commentary c1993) <br>
The stone of Elizabeth Dawson was outside the fence.&nbsp; It is propped 
standing up against a tree. The tree growth pressed against the stone and broke 
it. Elizabeth Dawson circa 1758 - 1831 is the oldest stone in this cemetery, far 
older than any of the Motes Stones. You will see an Easter Egg or two in the 
photos. I happened upon this cemetery just after the Easter Eggs were laid. The 
owner said it was OK and we agreed I would not move or touch the eggs.&nbsp; I 
went ahead with the photography and finished up &amp; left just before the little 
Easter bunnies came storming to the cemetery looking for eggs. Aw the delicate 
hazards of this business. (C Wayne Austin 26 Dec 2010) <br>
