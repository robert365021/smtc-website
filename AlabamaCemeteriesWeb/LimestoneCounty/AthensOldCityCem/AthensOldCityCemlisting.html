them horizontally - rotated 90 degrees and positioned them onto the base. The 
parts are pointing south across the head of the grave in the row. I find that is 
the best way to keep the stone out of the way of the lawnmowers and weed 
whackers as some of those guys &amp; gals are not careful. That also gets the parts 
off of the ground so that water drainage is better and the stone stays dryer.

[Richardson] died last night....This is the fourth grown child in four years of

because there was no room for his grave. The old burying ground is so full that 
they seldom, try to dig a grave without striking another.&quot; Billy was buried in 
the new cemetery which according to John Tanner was opened in 1849 with the 
interment of James Henry Allen although there seem to be earlier graves there, 
which suggests that it was a private burial ground before that time.

Cemetery notes and/or description: Located on the north side of East Washington 
Street by the Athens Board of Education. (CWA 2011)<br>
<br>
Also in the records there is an Old City Cemetery for African Americans, but 
unlike the graves here the monuments there are mostly late 1800's to mid to late 
1900's, but perhaps slaves and others are buried there in unmarked graves prior 
to modern times.<br>
<br>
There are no other reported Athens Old City Cemeteries. The Athens City Cemetery 
was founded before this oldest one ceased to be used about 1850. So there is an 
-- Athens City Cemetery, Old Section and an -- Athens City Cemetery, New Section 
which is confusing to some.<br>
<br>
The deed for this cemetery on Washington Street was recorded in 1825 in Deed 
Book 16, page 330, comprising 3 1/2 acres. Bettye Harrison prepared the&nbsp; 
listing which appeared in Valley Leaves in June 1973 from listings of Mrs. 
Pauline Jones Gandrud in 1928 and Mrs. George W. Smith about 1958. Stones not 
found by Bettye but listed in the earlier records are generally those without a 
photo. The results of that book can be found in the Athens Archive just west 
down the street across the tracks from this cemetery a quarter of a mile.<br>
<br>
An attempt was made to include past transcriptionist efforts which will yield a 
more complete listing. We know that is futile as there are lost &amp; crumbled 
stones and other unmarked graves yielding a record that is incomplete at best. 
However, we broke new ground in that we were able to list one or two other 
stones not shown in past records or books that we knew of, such as Ann Gamble 
who died in 1833. C Wayne Austin 12 Dec 2010.</font></p>
