<b>This road map shows the cemetery south of Athens between I-65 &amp; Mooresville 
Rd. To get here Go I-65 &amp; take Exit 340 onto I-565 east and go to Mooresville 
Exit 2 (2 miles) and go north past Belle Mina about 2 miles to County Rd 10. 
Take County Rd 10 for one mile and the cemetery is 50 yards north out into a 
field with the broken wrought iron fencing visible unless the crops are growing 
tall.<br>

Turn west onto what is labeled Fennell Road here and go one mile down that road. 
Just after you pass the farming operation headquarters the cemetery can usually 
be seen on the right just out from the road with broken and bent wrought iron 
fencing piled over the box tombs. The crop machinery and soft limestone has 
eroded the monuments of this cemetery over the years so that there is only two 
remaining readable stones of the four.<br>

This Aerial view shows the cemetery as as small dark spot near the road of a 
large cultivated field.<br>

Zooming in further we can see here the outline of the box tomb tops.<br>
