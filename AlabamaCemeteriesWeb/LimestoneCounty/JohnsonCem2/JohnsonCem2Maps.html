Go east on Nick Davis Road to Mooresville Road and turn south (or right). Go 
several hundred yards and find the Johnson Cemetery #2 on the left on a rise above the 
road.</b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="JohnsonCem2Aerial.jpg" width="1024" height="469"><br>
This aerial view uses a red check to
show the Johnson cemetery #2 located under a stand of trees on the west side of the road. 
It was kept up when I was there last.<br>
