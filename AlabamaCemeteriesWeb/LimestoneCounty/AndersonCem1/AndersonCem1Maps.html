This map shows the GPS Coordinates of the Anderson Cemetery as plotted by C. 
Wayne Austin. This is also known as the
Latitude and Longitude location. ACME Mapper #2:N 34.72644 W 86.83523 Alternate 
location:LOCATION: NW quarter, Sect. 3, T4S, R3W at the SW corner of Powell Rd. 
and Browns Ferry Rd.<br>

From Athens go west to French's Mill and turn south (right) on Mooresville Road (Hwy 
71). Go about nearly 3 miles and turn left on Browns-Ferry Rd. Go over 2 miles 
which included going down into the Limestone Creek Valley and across the&nbsp; 
creek and up the hill going under the giant TVA transmission towers and lines. 
At the top of the&nbsp; hill&nbsp; look south (right) out into the field for the 
dirt road turning into the cemetery. There are two dirt roads, the first and 
shortest one goes to the old home place, which is now&nbsp; just a large clump 
of bushes. The second field road goes first by a small thicket and then on to 
the Anderson cemetery as shown on the ACME map above. I am left wondering the 
why of the first thicket was left uncultivated unless there are maybe some old 
unmarked slave graves there. The road does not go to the cemetery so if you go 
here when crops are planted you will trample on the farmers crops. Late fall and 
after the wheat harvest in July are the best times, but immediately after the 
wheat harvest there is planting of soy beans so the visit window is narrow. <br>

This aerial view shows the cemetery inside a clump of trees south of 
Browns-Ferry Road. The Anderson Monument is in the southern part on the west 
side. The Robert Tinnin box tomb is next in the middle about 50 feet north of 
the Anderson tomb. The other two box tombs are on the north side of this thicket 
and was covered in vines and brush. When I first went there, I did not find 
them, until I saw the listings, which told of three more box tombs. I went back 
and practically had to dig all three of the box tombs up. The Tennin tomb was at 
least two inches under the soil. Thick vines covered all of that creating quite 
a clearing project to get the photographs.<br>
