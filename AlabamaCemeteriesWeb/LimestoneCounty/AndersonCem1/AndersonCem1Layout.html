This map shows the general layout of this cemetery. With this map one should be 
able to dig up the tombs on the future if they become covered again as I found 
them. I estimate the length of this cemetery to be about 35 yards N/S and 10 
yards E/W wide. That means the Anderson tomb is about 15 yards from the south 
end and the Robert Tomb is about 4 yards from the north end. The Jones Tomb is 
adjacent and just south of the Roberts Tomb with the Tinnin Tomb being about 15 
yards south of that. <br>
