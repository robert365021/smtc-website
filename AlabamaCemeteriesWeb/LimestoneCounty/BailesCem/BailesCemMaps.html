From Athens go North on Washington St./Hwy 127 to Hwy 55 which is Hays Mill Rd and veer north and follow 
that until it changes to Pettusville Road on the other side of Sandlin Road. Keep Pettusville Road until yo get to Shipley Hollow road and turn right (east). Keep 
Shipley Hollow Rd for a couple of miles and turn left on Ragsdale Creek Rd. 
Follow that for a mile and the cemetery is back in the hollow behind a home 
actually on land owned by a family west of there or fronting Pettusville Road. 
Deer season is followed by all these folks so better go when that is closed or 
you will be discourged by the locals. You will have to walk the distance 
from the road back to the cemetery. Instructions there is from sitting on 
Ragsdale Creek Rd at GPS 34.98089 X 86.952559 follow a field road which goes 
west but veers a bit south up a (Bailes Hollow) hollow between two hills until you reach the top 
of the hill in the clearing in the open field at GPS 34.97946 X 86.92932 and 
then turn 90 degrees right (facing north) and walk to the distant hedgerow of 
trees. When you reach the hedgerow or get close to it if you see the cemetery go 
toward it and cross the fence into the cemetery. If you do not see the cemetery 
continue walking until you reach the hedgerow and turn left (west) and follow 
along the south side of the hedgerow until you are next to the cemetery across 
the fence from you. The fence is not very well kept so it is easy to drop to the 
ground and crawl under it to prevent further damage to the fence. The fence is 
not a fence around the cemetery but a fence that spans the hedge row or property 
lines. When you reach the cemetery you are at GPS 34.98034 W 86.93022 in the 
center of the cemetery.<br>

cemetery. There was deer salt or feed stand just north of the cemetery.<br>
