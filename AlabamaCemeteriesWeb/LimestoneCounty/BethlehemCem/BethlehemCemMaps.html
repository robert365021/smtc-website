This map shows the GPS Coordinates of the Bethlehem Cemetery as plotted by C. 
Wayne Austin. This is also known as the
Latitude and Longitude location. ACME Mapper 2.0: N 34.71089 W 87.05487. <br>
Alternate Location: SE quarter of NE quarter, Sect. 9, T5S, R5W on a gravel road 
which turns south beside the Bethlehem Church.<br>
<img border="0" src="BethlehemCemRd.jpg" width="1920" height="974"><br>
From Athens go South on Hwy 231 and west on Brownsferry Road to Lucas Ferry Road 
and turn south. Go to Nuclear Plant Road and turn west. Go about 2 miles west to 
Bethlehem Church or Bethlehem Church Road (gravel) and turn south. Go several 
hundred yards to the cemetery on the right under a stand of trees. There is some 
maintenance occurring on the grounds, but hardly any on the tombs.<br>

This aerial view uses a green marker to
show the cemetery located under a few trees. I attempted to draw a yellow 
outline to approximate the area of the cemetery.<br>

This view of the cemetery shows the Bethlehem Road branching south off of 
Nuclear Plant Road. However the Bethlehem road hardly goes further than the 
cemetery except for capable farmers and bushman. The road goes from being a gravel 
road to a dirt one.<br>
