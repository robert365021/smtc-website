<p align="center"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#800000" size="2">WALTON CEMETERY, Barlow 
Road, LIMESTONE COUNTY ALABAMA<br/>
</font><img border="0" height="802" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/LimestoneCounty/WaltonCem/WaltonCemGPS.jpg" width="1807"/></font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><br/>
This map shows the GPS Coordinates of the Walton Cemetery as plotted by C. 
Wayne Austin. This is also known as the
Latitude and Longitude location. ACME Mapper: N 34.62113 W -86.81340. Alternate Location: NE 
quarter, Sect. 11, Township 5S, Range 3W in the middle of a field.  The 
cemetery sits on a concrete slab around all the stones. One small stone either 
had no writing or the inscription was covered by the concrete. It sits on the 
northeast corner of the cemetery and is a concrete marker dated about 1900. Two 
of the stones are box-tombs. King Walton has an age on the tombstone but it is 
buried deeply and cannot be read with any degree of certainty though I think I 
see the top of a 4 and 7 meaning he was 47 years of age in 1905.</font></b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b><br/>

From County Line Road in Madison go south past I-565 another 5+ miles and 
turn right into SW Wall St and go about 1/4 mile and turn north (right) into Swanscott Road follow that until it turns back west and then go about 2/3 of a 
mile and turn right (north) into Bilow Rd SW. Follow that until it dead ends on Barlow road. 
Turn left (west) and go to the end of Barlow Road and if the weather is dry turn 
off the road and follow a field road for 250 yards out to the cemetery on your 
right sitting on a concrete pad.<br/>

This aerial view shows the cemetery better in relation to Barlowe Road. I have 
outlined it in yellow.<br/>
