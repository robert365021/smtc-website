This aerial view shows the cemetery inside a clump of trees south of 
a hedge of trees northeast of Myers Road. The home in the northwest corner of 
the map is probably where the permission/notification lies.<br>

This road view image from google shows the old McCully home across the street 
from the cemetery where the McCully's lived. Its truly in its setting sun. I am 
told it will soon be burned to make way for new homes.</i></b></p>
