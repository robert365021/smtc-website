From Athens travel east on Hwy 72 and turn south on Mooresville Road. Go to 
Mooresville and take old highway 20 eastward to Pryor Road and turn south and go about 1 
mile and you will see the grain silos on the left and the cemetery across the 
road sprawled back 
to your right behind a chain link fence. It is overgrown in Brush so be prepared 
for that. </b></font><b><font color="#000080" size="2">I went there a year ago 
and cleared some if it but it still needs work.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><img border="0" src="PeeblesCemAerial.jpg" width="1019" height="469"><br>
This aerial view above
shows the cemetery located in the small clump of trees across the road from the 
Grain Silos. A long span of fencing leads up to the road with a gate that could 
be locked if the owners so desired. The cemetery has been cared for in the past 
with ornamental plants that have been overrun by massive dense privy hedge which 
I cleared much of it but it remains a problem.<br>
