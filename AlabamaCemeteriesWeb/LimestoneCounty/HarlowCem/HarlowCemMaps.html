From Athens go out N. Jefferson St and veer right onto Hays Mill Road. Follow 
that across Thatch Road where it becomes Pettusville Road and follow that and you find the left turn onto Spence Cave Road. 
Spence Cave Rd winds and twist around, but just before 
the State Line look to the left under a grove of trees. There is a road to the 
Payne Cemetery which is African-American and along that road to the right is the 
Harlow Cemetery which is&nbsp; a white cemetery and much smaller and older. Well 
it is fair to say at least the marked graves are much older in the Harlow 
Cemetery. Who knows about the age of the many unmarked graves in the Payne 
Cemetery.<br>
