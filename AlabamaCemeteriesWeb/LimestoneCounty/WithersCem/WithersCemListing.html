*I noticed the grave sink &amp; fragments of the crumbling stone mentioned in 
Linda Smith's book, but I believe the inscription has 
disappeared since Linda Smith &amp; husband visited here 8 Apr 1990 or nearly 25 
years ago.<br>
Two or three tombstone bases were found 
with no evidence of the actual stone. These seem to be of concrete which dates 
them to the early 1900s, but it is possible they were cut from weak limestone and 
thus could be dated earlier. *One large stone had fallen over into an 
extremely large &quot;grave sink&quot; and any hope of reading the inscription has 
been lost. This is an indication of a wooden casket and poor back filling of the 
grave. More 
stones may exist, but were not found today 15 Mar 2015. A serious clearing of 
the cemetery needs to occur to find anymore tombstones.<br>
<br>
There were a total of three sinks that had no tombstones including the one 
listed above with the surname Jones. I think it safe to declare that person had 
the surname Jones.</b> <a href="IMG_4169.JPG">4169</a>/<a href="IMG_4171.JPG">4171</a><b>/same

**Palmyra was the daughter of Thomas S. Jones &amp; Mary Withers Jones and the first 
wife of Nial Southard (Dec 7, 1854 - Sep 30, 1905) who is buried in Texarkana, 
Miller Co., Ark<br>
with his second family. Contributed by Nancy S. Oliver. See findagrave.com&nbsp; 
&lt; http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=southard&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=56892&amp;GRid=39015130&amp; 
&gt;<br>
No mention is made in Arkansas of the 2nd wife. Nail's stone is a modest 
concrete marker no longer utilized in marking graves, because of their being 
fragile.<br>
<br>
These stones in this cemetry are very thick &amp; heavy and can withstand trees falling on them to some 
degree, but the Eliza Jones monument has already been knocked from it base. The 
inscription is still available to the public though.<br>
<br>
The old Withers homeplace is gone now. The brush &amp; decay have taken over. It originally 
looked to Linda &amp; Wayne Smith back in 1990 to have been first damaged by high winds. The cemetery is now 
under large trees, and except for a few saw briars most of the overgrown&nbsp;vines has been shaded 
out. Periwinkle has now covered the graves. <br>
The woodland area is very large because it encompassed the home, graveyard  
including probably barns which all have been allowed to return to mother nature 
or abolished.&nbsp;All 
those assets stood for about 100 year, being built around the 1840s in the 
business boom of that time &amp; was destroyed sometime after about 1940 to 1960. The graveyard is 
in the far south-west corner of the woodland&nbsp;in an area that is 
higher than the surrounding terrain. <br>

the end of his road where it was collected by a truck or team of mules in 
earlier times. The receipts from the milk were credited toward the purchase of

damaged them beyond repair causing their demolition, but nuttin against &quot;Po

<i>This Cemetery presentation is based on the photography of Wayne Austin on 
15 Mar 2015. Final editing and uploading by the same on 16 May 2015. It was also presented in the book Limestone County Alabama 
Cemeteries by Linda &amp; Wayne Smith on Page 515, 8 Apr 1990 published within a 
couple years of that. They omitted the listing for John Wright Withers d. 1836. 
Other than that - perfect. </i></b></font></p>
