This map shows the GPS Coordinates of the Withers Cemetery as plotted by C. 
Wayne Austin. This is also known as the
Latitude and Longitude location. ACME Mapper: N 34.67766 W -86.79320. Alternate Location: SouthEast 
Quarter of Section 24, Township 4S, Range 3W, about 1/4 mile south of the 
railroad tracks in the woods near the Madison County line. The Madison county 
line being along County Line Road.</font></b><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><br>

From Athens go west about 9 miles to Madison County and turn south on County 
Line Road. Go about 6 miles and after you pass over the Railroad Overpass turn 
right into the long concrete drive of the Concrete business among other 
businesses. When the road comes to an end, with permission to cross the concrete 
wall, go out into the field and walk south about 350 yards according to the 
arrows drawn on the below map. Go into the woods from the north side and walk 
about 100 feet into the woods and you will see these very thick stones. You 
should be even with the&nbsp;cemetery when in the northwest corner of the woodlands or 
about 50 feet inside the field-line from the closest western edge.<br>

This aerial view uses yellow arrows to direct you to the cemetery. Whether or 
not you choose this route, it is not recommended unless you have 
prior permission and good climbing shoes to scale a 4 foot 
high &amp; 3 foot thick concrete wall. At my best in my youth I could high jump that without 
touching the surface, so much for that, age spoils everything. 
I used the above route because it was not possible to drive any closer due to the 
recent rains &amp; snows. The fields were very muddy.<br>
Another more recommended route north of here is to go along the south side of the railroad 
tracks 
following a field road going west until you are due north of the cemetery and 
then turn south and walk (or drive if the farmer won't mind and the land is dry, 
without crops) 
directly toward the woodland coming in at the same place as shown by the arrows. Do not tear up the 
crop land with with trucks causing deep ruts.&nbsp; &quot;Snuffy Smiff the farmer 
might come out with both barrels blasting if not&quot;. Any other place to enter the woodland is 
not recommended because that will get you torn &amp; pricked by briars and brush. 
Also do not explore this woodland. There are pits and holes that can consume you 
from an old fallen home which probably had a basement that was 15 or so feet 
deep and now is full of water. This woodland is deadly for a lot of reasons. 
Especially to a novice. Also there may be several old wells around this woodland 
or even other places to get ones self 
killed if not alert. I don't know where the old home stood as I did not go 
exploring.</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
