</font></b><b>This was at one 
time a large cemetery. There are many bricks scattered around, an indications of 
vaults. It is located on land bought by John and Burwell Holt in 1818. These 
are the early members of the Holt family from this area who are buried here. There is a large 
area said to be the slave cemetery which I suppose blends into the Leslie 
(African American) graveyard beginning about 50 yards east of here. Also it is known a Civil war skirmish was fought 
near here (unconfirmed) and some believe members of a Confederate unit are interred&nbsp;here. Both 
of the Scott men died during or close to the end of the Civil war. I do not know  
whether it was in battle or not. They died at different times.<br>
<br>
Except for the unmarked graves the cemetery was surveyed from the north to the 
south with the photo numbers being the lowest on the north side. That order 
beginning to the north was the (1) unmarked tomb with bricks/(2)the James Allen stone 
and immediately beside that (3) Jesse Holt. Next after several skips or unmarked 
graves is the (4) Martha Crawford stone followed and side by side after many more 
spaces the (5) Scott tomb tops found at the southern most place. 
Grave sinks may be found scattered all around.<br>

This Cemetery presentation is based on the photography of C. Wayne Austin on 17 
Mar 2015.&nbsp; Site linkage &amp; programming&nbsp; &amp; adding to this site occurring 
on 19 Mar 2015 by the same.&nbsp; It also appeared in the book Tombstone 
Inscriptions of Limestone County Alabama, By Linda Smith, 1992 on page 230 as 
taken 16 Mar 1986 by Philip Reyer &amp;&nbsp; Steve Inman for Linda's book.&nbsp; 
They had Joseph Scott born in 1816 in error.&nbsp; Sowhat I make mistakes too. The cemetery shows up on findagrave 
but with no one finding or visiting it which means it is a basically a copy of 
what Linda Smith's group found. Well this is somewhat too but with 
organizational differences and photos.</i></p><p align="center"><b><a href="../../index.html"><img border="0" src="../CunninghamCem/buttontornad.jpg" width="82" height="44" font <></a></b></p>
