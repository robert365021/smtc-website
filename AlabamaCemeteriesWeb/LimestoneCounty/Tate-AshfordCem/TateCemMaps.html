From I 65 take the Old Hwy 20 exit toward Madison Alabama and go to the traffic 
light and turn south on County Line Road and to go to Swanscott Road and follow 
that a until it bears back north and then back westward. Go to where Billow Road 
junctions with Swanscott Road and turn south (left) on a dirt road and follow 
that about 300 yards and park and walk southwest for about 350 yards to the lone 
clump of trees in the plowed field where you will find this small abandoned 
cemetery. You will not be able to go here in the growing season without 
trampling on the farmers crops so the best time is December unless they plant 
wheat then go in October after the cotton or bean harvest but before the wheat 
is planted. </b></font><b><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><img border="0" src="Tate-AshfordCemAerial.jpg" width="1577" height="607"><br>
This aerial view above
shows the cemetery located in the small clump of trees. The old home stood in 
the larger clump of trees I think, but according to the book Limestone County 
Cemeteries the cemetery was east of the house.<br>
