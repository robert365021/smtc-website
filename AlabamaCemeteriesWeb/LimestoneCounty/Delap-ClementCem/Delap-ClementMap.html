From Ardmore go south on Hwy 53 toward Huntsville and turn right on Cedar Hill 
Road. Travel 3 tenths of a mile and&nbsp; turn left into a residential road with 
houses along it. Go past all the houses about 400 yards and into the gate. The 
cemetery is in a field. The grass is allowed to grow up in the summer time 
making the stones not so easily found. The above map wrongly labels Cedar Hill 
Road as Elkwood Section Road. This road is Elkwood Section Road on the east side 
of Hwy 53.<br>

This aerial view above
shows the area of the cemetery highlighted in yellow. The graves are back in the 
northeast corner of that square shaped separately fenced field.<br>
