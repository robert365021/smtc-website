There are three large slabs, 1 upright tombstone also marks the head of the
middle slab and 2 field- stones. The Lucy Byrde memorial is already being
undermined by soil erosion and will eventually slide into the ditch below
without maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also grass does not grow on the bank south 
(next to) of Lucey's tomb and there is a danger that without grass the soil will 
wash away and expose grave remains.</p>
