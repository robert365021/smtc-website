Samuel Sloan &amp; Elizabeth Patterson SLOAN. Married to Eliza Stinnett Sloan 8 
March 1836 in Limestone Co., AL. It is my opinion that there was at one time a 
stone for him here. There are blank bases aligned in a row beside Margaret

<b>No doubt some of the settlers of early French's Mill Community are interred 
here. This is one of three cemeteries near the French's Mill at the junction of 
Highway 72 &amp; Mooresville Road. These two roads are among the earliest roads 
built in Alabama. Bethel Cemetery is another cemetery that served the settlers 
of French's Mill which resides along the creek banks of French's Creek named 
after Benjamin French (1764-1847) who lived here for a time but, but died in 
Lauderdale County somewhere between Lexington and Rogersville where he last 
lived. Benjamin and his son Amos and their families came here as early as 1808 
when the Chickasaw Indians burned their cabin and drove them back toward 
Huntsville. A son Amos and his family came back in 1816 and finished his life 
here. Sources: Cemetery compilations &amp; mappings of this site by C. Wayne Austin

<a href="5073.JPG">5073</a>/After:<a href="9672-.JPG">9672</a></b></span><b> was taken after 
the EF5 Tornado of 27 Apr 2011 at about 4:30 PM came through here. Among other 
trees the storm uprooted a large Red Oak 
tree just east of this (J.D. Thomas) stone. The tree &amp; monument are shown intact in the above first photo 
#5073. This event created a large pit which caused the memorial stone to plunge into 
the hole some 4+ feet down.
This stone was then in severe danger of disappearing underground as this giant 
root ball dissolves (from the weather) back into the pit. It would have gradually 
covered the stone (forever) as the dirt melted away from the root ball and fell back 
in the hole. 
It will take a major effort to salvage this stone because of the depth of the 
pit. Any effort will create danger to the salvage effort because the root ball is 
capable of caving off and pinning anyone attempting to salvage the stone. Due 
care must be taken.
Now we are made aware of another reason why some of our old tombstones are 
disappearing. It is called storms. 
This above mentioned storm is the same one that destroyed Hackleburg/Phil 
Campbell/French's Mill &amp; Harvest, Alabama (and many other places) across a span of 90+ Miles. 
That storm killed 
50+ people and the hospitals were filled with the injured. <br>
<br>

This cemetery was so devastated now that it likely will be abandoned and grow up 
in brush over time because of the inability now to mow it. I am not trying to be 
negative, but that is what I have seen happen too many times in the past. If you can 
help prevent this please do so. I did go there a few days later with a lift 
tripod &amp; Hoist and pull the John David Thomas monument from the pit. I left it 
standing on the ground 5 feet southwest of the original place, The gravestone 
base was left in the pit because it was deeper down and face down with only a 
small part showing. I declared it unsalvageable due to the danger of dirt caving 
in and also I did not want to disturb anymore the raw remains of the grave 
exposed in the pit when the tree uprooted in the storm. Unless intervention 
comes its way all that pit will fill 
back mostly when the dirt from the rootball washes back into the hole over time. 
It can be leveled back up in time.<br>
Update: A Tornado Crew showed up later and cleared the trees and covered the 
holes and now the cemetery looks good, but still there is a problem of summer 
growth taking over as mentioned. <br>
