From Athens go west to French's Mill and turn south on Mooresville Road (Hwy 
71). Go about 1/4 mile and turn left into a field road that bends left then back 
right toward the westward direction to the cemetery bout 500 yards out into the 
field under a grove of trees which were mostly destroyed during the EF5 Tornado 
of 27 Apr 2011. Andrews Cemetery can be seen just to the north of the black line 
of the tornado. The actual tornado damage pattern was much wider then the black 
line.<br>

This exploded view of the above map shows (in detail) the small grove of trees 
where the cemetery is located. Also the field road can be seen spanning in a 
crooked fashion from Mooresville Road to the cemetery and continuing on to the 
creek in the forest shown on the left. The Clem Mobile Home Park seen on the 
right was totally destroyed by the twisters of 27 Apr 2011. Also both of the 
houses seen on this map east of the cemetery beside Mooresville Road are now 
gone.<br>
