(Alexander) CEMETERY, (Carey Road abt 10 miles NE of Athens) , LIMESTONE COUNTY, ALABAMA<br>
<img border="0" src="IMG_6436.JPG" width="710" height="533"><br>
This picture shows the large tree which hovers over this cemetery. The graves
are actually about 10 yards southeast of this tree. This is not a substantial
tree and will succumb in a few years, but there is a White oak tree southeast of
the graves that should last hundreds of years though it is now small. I had to
cut my way thru this dense foliage to get into there. Growing on the west and
south of this graveyard is a stand of cultivated Pine trees. I am told an old
house at one time sat next to Carey Road. Could the Alexander Black family have
lived there. I was told by an old gentleman down further on Carey Road the who
descends from this family that he visited the Alexander Black farm as a child.
He said that location would now be on the Black Road southeast of here some
three miles. He said they lived on the north side of Black Road and had an apple
orchard because as a child he was scolded for plucking and eating the apples.</b><b><br>

uneventful photo in the cemetery shows an old Rose bush vine that can lives
hundreds of years. It has inhabited this graveyard since earlier times. This
bush was likely planted by the family in the early 1900s or maybe even earlier.</span><br>

<b>Some of the remainder of the graveyard assets can be
seen in this photo. Here we see the only tombstone base that can be found here.
It is broken off down next to the flat base. The little stone in the upper left
of the photo is a foot marker. It shows no sign of an inscription. All this may
be part of the memorial for Sarah Lewter Crawford Black.</b></font></p>
