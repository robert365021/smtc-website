<p><font size="2">This graveyard has been destroyed by vandals or it succumbed
to time &amp; neglect. It
is now void of any formal standing
memorials. Left there are fragments of gravestones that have bits and pieces of
inscriptions which are enough to give information, but also leaves questions. This 
researcher has done a brief
and non-invasive
<a href="Black(Alexander)CemStudy.htm">scientific study of this graveyard</a> looking for clues as to who
in the Alexander Black family is interred here in this old lost &amp; abandoned
gravesite.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">**Alexander Black remarried after the death of his wife 
assuming this is the same Alexander Black as it appears to be:<br>
Mary Ellen Willett married Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; Black in Limestone County, Alabama 
on 16 August 1894. This does not appear to be a marriage resulting in children 
due to Alexander's age assuming Mary was past child bearing age.<br>
