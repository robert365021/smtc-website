<p><a href="Black(Alexander)Cem02.html">BLACK, Alexander</a>, born 1838 &amp; died 1910. (son of John
Black &amp; Winnie Hite Peace Black married 23 Jan 1861, Alexander 2nd married
to Mary E. Willett 16 Aug 1894)**<br>
<a href="Black(Alexander)CemL01.html">
BLACK, Sarah Jane Lewter Crawford</a>, born - likely in 1842 - died 6 Aug
1893,&nbsp; married to Alexander Black 23 Jan 1861.<br>
LOGGINS, Martha Frances Black, born
1872 - died before 1910. (daughter of Alexander &amp; Winnie Black; married to
Major Loggins, 18 Aug 1889.)</p>
<p>This graveyard has been destroyed by vandals or it succumbed
to time &amp; neglect. It
is now void of any formal standing
memorials. Left there are fragments of gravestones that have bits and pieces of
inscriptions which are enough to give information, but also leaves questions. This 
researcher has done a brief
and non-invasive
<a href="Black(Alexander)CemStudy.html">scientific study of this graveyard</a> looking for clues as to who
in the Alexander Black family is interred here in this old lost &amp; abandoned
gravesite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>**Alexander Black remarried after the death of his wife 
assuming this is the same Alexander Black as it appears to be:<br>
Mary Ellen Willett married Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; Black in Limestone County, Alabama 
on 16 August 1894. This does not appear to be a marriage resulting in children 
due to Alexander's age assuming Mary was past child bearing age.<br>
