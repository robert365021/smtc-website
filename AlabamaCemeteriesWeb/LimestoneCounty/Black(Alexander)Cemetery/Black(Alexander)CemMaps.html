This cemetery is located on the s</span>outh side of Carey Road just after the
2nd 90 degree bend in the road going east from Hays Mill Road. About 50 yards
from the road under a stand of trees. The map shows above that it is in the SE
corner of Porter Gin &amp; Carey Rd back in the thicket. vegetation is very
dense back in there.<br>
Using another method the cemetery is located in SE quarter (center of) Section
15, Township 2 South &amp; Range 4 West. The location is as I find it is in the
center of Section 15, (but, abt 50 yards south and 200 yards west of the
center), Township 2 South &amp; Range 4 West. You will find this cemetery at the
GPS Coordinates of 34.87635 degrees North and 86.94140 degrees West.</b><br>
