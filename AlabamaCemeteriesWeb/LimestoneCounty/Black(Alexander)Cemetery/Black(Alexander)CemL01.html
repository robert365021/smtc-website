(Alexander) CEMETERY, (Carey Road abt 10 miles NE of Athens), LIMESTONE COUNTY, ALABAMA</b><b><br>

BLACK, Sarah Jane Lewter Crawford, born - likely in 1842 - died 6 Aug 1893,
married to Alexander Black 23 Jan 1861.<br>
<b>I may be incorrect, but this assembly of stones has some
detail known to match the vital data of Sarah Black. For (1) it is known she
died 6(or 5th) of August 1893. The above fragment matches that. (2) the date
(birth year) (but, broken off) looks like it could be 1842 or there about. That
is close (or exactly) her birth year.&nbsp;<br>
Evidence running counter to there is the fragment that comes from a thinner
stone which states &quot;Sarah wife of&quot; which is on a thinner piece of
stone and does not match up to the above thicker stone, It also seems to have
details of Sarah, wife of Alexander Black. Some cemetery sources believe there
was a daughter Sarah that lived from 1872 - 1893, but I cannot confirm that with
the fragments of stone I found. I believe they were concluding that from the
above fragments.</b>
