Find this cemetery by going into historic Mooresville Alabama and travel down 
Broad Street and pass off from the Paved Street into the Wheeler Wildlife 
Refuge. If the gate is closed due to being closed in the winter then stop here 
and walk. Walk or ride for .34 of a mile and look west (right) into the old 
Mooresville Cemetery on the hill under the large trees. The road is maintained 
and not muddy. At about .4 of a mile the road turns to the east (left) so branch 
south. on a branch road. After about 20 yards&nbsp; or now a total mileage of 
.450 you will exit into the large long field that spans southwest jutting into 
the Backwaters of the Tennessee River in the Limestone Creek boggs. After you 
exit into the field follow along the waters edge on the left side of the field 
for about 450 yards to the point the tree line juts the furtherest into the 
field. That is about the highest point of your walk along the left edge of the 
field. From there go left (east) into the trees 30 feet and find the cemetery 
lined up north to south with the graves &amp; headstones facing east. <br>
