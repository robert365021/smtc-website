This is what Linda Smith in her book said about this cemetery: 
&quot;On Brown's Ferry Rd. at Burgreen's Gin. At one time, there was a low concrete 
block wall around this cemetery but it is partially knocked down and surrounded 
by mounds of cotton hulls from the gin. All names appear on one stone which was 
placed there by family members some years ago. Copied Mar. 21, 1991, Linda 
Smith.&quot;<br>
