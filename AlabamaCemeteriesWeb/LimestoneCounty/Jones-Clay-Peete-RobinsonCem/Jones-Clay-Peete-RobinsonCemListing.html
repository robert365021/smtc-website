I don't know why the name of this cemetery in the past excluded the name of Jones 
as a part of its cemetery name. If the cemetery is named after the graves of marked burials Jones is perhaps 
the oldest and most prominent <br>
name in this cemetery. I did not find the tombstone for Walter Preston&nbsp;Clay, and 
also there were no Peete graves found here that I know of. I added the name 
Jones on the front of the previous publisher's naming of this <br>
cemetery even though their authors never found the cemetery to update it. The 
area of this cemetery was fenced with concrete post and iron railing way back 
when. The cemetery is large enough for <br>
only about 4 more graves which I could not identify because, the 
fieldstones if, there ever were any, were abolished long ago by time and neglect.&nbsp;

This is a very old cemetery and all the box tombs are dismantled probably by 
Vandals in the past. The inscribed tops are all broken up. The general 
difference between the damage between vandals and trees is that vandals break up 
the tombs and displace the parts whereas large tree limbs smash them in place 
except when a large tree falls and a tomb is sitting on the root ball of the 
tree. In that case the tomb may fall into newly formed hole in the ground and be 
lost forever. There are only two of the bases still standing but none of the 
tops are in place. They could still be associated with the graves but it takes 
some work and studying the grounds. <br>
Complete stone restoration here would be a very difficult task. As long as the 
inscribed tops stay above the ground there are no gains to be had long term for 
survival of this cemetery by tombstone restoration.<br>
<br>
Please do not disturb the privacy of the nearby neighbor's homes by visiting 
here unless you get permission 
in advance. This cemetery is very near private 
homes. Unless you are a descendent of this cemetery<br>
there is no reason to visit here with the addition of this complete publication.&nbsp; I promise you, you will see more on this site 
of this cemetery, than you 
ever will by an on-site visit because the tombs are hard to identify and<br>
find and even especially hard to read without the special preparation of the 
stones that I did. [CWA]</font></font></p>
