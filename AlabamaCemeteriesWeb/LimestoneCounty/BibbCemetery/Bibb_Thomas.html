				<b>According to &quot;Wicked North Alabama&quot; by 
				Jacquelyn Procter Reeves, Thomas Bibb was born in 1843. When he 
				was 14, in 1858, one of Porter Bibb's (Thomas' father) slaves, 
				Larkin, asked Thomas to come to the woods with him to show him a 
				turkey's nest. While there, Larkin hit Thomas five or six times 
				in the head and left him there to die when he was called away by 
				another slave. When Larkin went back an hour or so later, Thomas 
				was still alive. Larkin then shot Thomas, carried his body to a 
				pond and sunk it with logs. Larkin confessed and was sentenced 
				to death. He was hanged on September 27, 1858.&nbsp;</b></div>
			<div>
				<b><br>
				The last paragraph of the story reads: &quot;The tiny Bibb Cemetery, 
				protected by a copse of cedar trees, holds the bodies of members 
				of the Bibb family, including young Thomas. With no words to 
				betray the circumstances of his death, the headstone of Thomas 
				Bibb sums up the tragedy with a simple inscription: Died in 
				young manhood.&quot;</b></div>

				<b>So they never put dates on it, just that 
				statement. <br>
&nbsp;</b><div>
					<b>I found a book at the library that tells 
					the story of what happened to Thomas Bibb. Please post.</b></div>
