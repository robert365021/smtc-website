&nbsp;Thomas Bibb
built this grand house (photo not available) in 1826 and named it &quot;Belle Manor&quot; (beautiful
home)., but local pronunciation altered it to &quot;Belle Mina&quot;.&nbsp; The home which
stayed in the Bibb family until 1940 was the seat of Bibb's large plantation,
and furnished the name of the small town nearby. The town of Belle Mina developed
(later) around a railroad station intended for the nearby town of Mooresville, the
residents of which didn't want it built too close to their homes and businesses. <a href="6982.JPG">6982</a>/<a href="6982-.JPG">6982-</a></font></p>

<br>
An old ghost tale recently told at the annual &quot;Maple 
Hill Cemetery Stroll&quot;.<font color="#000080"> <br>
When the Governor Thomas Bibb's term ended and time came to break up the 
Governors Home, in Huntsville 17 miles east of here, a discussion between Thomas 
&amp; his wife ensued as to where they would live. Thomas wanted to come back to his 
old home here in Belle Mina/(Manor) because he deeply loved the serenity and 
quietness of the rural life. His wife disagreed as she was contented with the 
active social circles of early Huntsville. The Governor's wife won out and they 
continued to live in Huntsville, but the Governor was never completely content 
with the decision. He made many trips back to the old home place here. It is 
said that in the quietness of the night one can see &amp; hear the hustle and bustle 
of the apparition of the Governor shuttling back and forth between Huntsville's 
Maple Hill Cemetery and Belle Mina Alabama some 17+ miles away. [As told here by 
Wayne Austin. 9 Sep 2010. I do not recall the name of the actors at the Stroll 
who related this story, but if you get a chance to attend this annual spring 
event you will enjoy it.]</font></font></p>
