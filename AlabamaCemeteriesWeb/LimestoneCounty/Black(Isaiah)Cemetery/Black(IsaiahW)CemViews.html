This photo shows the cemetery 150 feet from Carey Road in the distance out in a
corn field enclosed in a brush covered chain link fence. The tree hovering in
the foreground is a large Pecan tree next to the road.<br>

<font color="#000080"><b>From this photo we see the only formal memorial in this
cemetery. In the area just to our left is the place where the fieldstones&nbsp;
are located. Groundhogs have rooted them around to the point they may not stand
any longer. Large Groundhog holes are infesting this graveyard making it a
hazard to walk in due to the risk of stepping into their holes. That also
destroys the integrity of the graveyard by making it hard to tell sunken graves
from sunken Groundhog dens. They are living inside the grave cavity. Ugh!<br>
