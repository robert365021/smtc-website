</font><b>Go Hayes Mill Road off of Hwy 127 and turn right on
Carey Road going east. Follow that road until it turns 90 degrees south and then
back 90 degrees east (the second turn). Then go 1/2 way to Slate Road or about
1/4 mile and look left (or north) at a small thicket in the middle of a
cornfield 150 feet out from the road. If you approach it from the west the
cemetery will be out from a large Pecan Tree next to the road. The cemetery is
inside a chain link fence. You will not be able to visit this cemetery until the
Corn harvest is in, otherwise you will be trampling on the farmer's corn crop.</b><br>
