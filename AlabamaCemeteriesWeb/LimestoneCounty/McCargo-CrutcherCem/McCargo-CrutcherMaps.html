Go east on Hwy 251 (old Hwy 31) to the Harvest Road. Turn east (right) there and 
go about 3 miles and near the end passing over Limestone Creek. The cemetery is north of the road in a 
cultivated field in a 
round grove of trees. It is marked with a red check on the above map.</b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="McCargo-CrutcherAerial.jpg" width="1024" height="471"><br>
This aerial view uses a yellow pointer to
show the cemetery located in the small clump of trees. The cemetery resides in 
the middle to eastern and southern part of that clump of trees. Evidence is seen 
of graves in other parts of that grove of trees though.<br>

This is more a view into the area that has few if any graves, except for the 
lower left corner of the photo where we can see the Crutcher family graves 
monuments<br>
