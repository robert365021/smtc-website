This photos shows the rows of graves running north/south. The vines are deep and
visibility is difficult though.<br>

We are looking northeast at the eastern row also covered by vines. In the
distance is an old barn, in front of that next to the road is an old historic
house that likely had connections to the folks that inhabit this graveyard.<br>
