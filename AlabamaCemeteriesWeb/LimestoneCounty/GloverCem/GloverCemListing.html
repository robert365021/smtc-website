NOTE: There was a large dismantled box tomb adjacent to Nathaniel that was

<br>
While I was there the bulldozers were busy clearing the adjacent 
land for a new medical business purported to be coming here. What is interesting 
to me is that there was a clump of trees next to the road which was destroyed by 
their efficient efforts that I had always assumed to be a slave graveyard. 
Usually in pre-civil war days there was a slave graveyard near the white settler 
graveyard, but I don't believe anyone considered this as it is now disappeared 
and a building is underway.<br>

<p>1820 - Alabama Became a State<br>
Wednesday, November 19, 2008 �THE GLOVER CEMETERY�<br>
Madison Spirit - Mr. John Rankin<br>
<br>
An old cemetery with five marked graves and probably several more that are 
unmarked is east of Burgreen Road and north of Brown's Ferry Road and diagonally 
opposite the B&amp;B Cross Roads Restaurant in Limestone County.<br>
It is in the wooded area behind one of the recent housing developments along 
County Line Road in Madison.<br>
The cemetery appears to have been established by the family of Nathaniel Glover. 
He was the only person of that surname to patent government land in the western 
part of Madison County in the 1800s. In 1833, he patented 83 acres north of 
Brown's Ferry Road and along both sides of today's Dock Murphy Road between 
Liberty Middle School and County Line Road. However, according to the extensive 
inscription on his box crypt tablet, Nathaniel Glover came to the area in 1820, 
almost a year after Alabama became a state. Glover must have also occupied land 
to the west in Limestone County.<br>
The fragments of Nathaniel's box crypt were reassembled in 2003, and the 
inscription was enhanced to read the entire legend on the tablet. It was as 
follows with spelling as shown:<br>
&quot;Sacred to the Memory of Nathaniel Glover. Was born in Northampton County, North 
Carolina October the 9th in the year of our Lord 1797. Was married to Miss 
Rebekah Glover August 17th 1820 and Emigrated to this State in the fall of 1820 
and departed this life on the 12th of September 1840 in the 43rd year of his 
age, Leaving a wife and six Children and maney friends to morne his loss. In 
life was a kind husband and an affectionate Father, a good neighbor, and was 
loved by all who knew him.&quot;<br>
The initials of the inscriber were noted as &quot;J.L.P.,&quot; and from another tablet in 
the cemetery that gave the last name, it is known that the initials were those 
of J.L. Preston. Census records through 1880 show that James L. Preston of 
Decatur was a stonemason born about 1810 in Pennsylvania.<br>
Nathaniel's box crypt, along with all others in the cemetery, was broken into 
pieces some time ago. Thunderstorms often topple large trees that can fall 
across box crypts and shatter them, as well as break other types of tombstones. 
In fact, only one tombstone remains intact here, and it is not likely to be 
original. The tombstone for Fredericca Perkins, who died at age 78, appears to 
have been of more recent vintage than the indicated death date of 1828. The 
relationship of Mrs. Perkins to the Glovers is unknown. All other grave markers 
in the cemetery are for Glover family members.<br>
Another adult-sized box crypt tablet contains the inscription, &quot;Sacred to the 
memory of Alexander Glover, born in Northampton County, North Carolina, August 
the 4th in the year of our Lord 1800 and departed this life Jan. 6th, 1835, 
leaving a wife and four children.&quot; Again, stonemason J.L. Preston inscribed his 
name as the maker of the tablet. Entries on Ancestry.com show that in 
Northampton County, N.C., a Capt. Jones Glover (1765-1828) and his wife, Judith 
Love, had children named Nathaniel, Alexander, John William and Mary of ages 
that fit the local family of Glovers.<br>
The 1830 Limestone County census shows Nathaniel living next door to a Will P. 
Glover who was 10 to 20 years younger. This Will P. Glover may have been a son 
that Nathaniel named after his brother John William. Apparently, Nathaniel's 
brother Alexander came to Alabama and is buried in the cemetery with Nathaniel. 
However, Nathaniel probably died in Lawrence County because he is found with his 
family in the 1840 census, which was taken just before his death. Since at least 
two of his children are known to be buried in Limestone's Glover Cemetery, 
Nathaniel must have specified that he be returned here for his own burial.<br>
