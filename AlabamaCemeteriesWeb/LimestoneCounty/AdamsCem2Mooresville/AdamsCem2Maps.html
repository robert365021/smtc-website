<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">ADAMS CEMETERY #2, Brick Church, Mooresville, LIMESTONE COUNTY 
ALABAMA</font><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><img border="0" src="AdamsCemGPS.jpg" width="1792" height="788"><br>
This map shows the GPS Coordinates of the Adams Monuments as plotted by C. 
Wayne Austin. This is also known as the
Latitude and Longitude location. ACME Mapper 2.0: N 34.62663 W 86.87990. <br>
The original cemetery was just off Hwy. 20 at Mooresville near the house of Dr. W. K. Adams 
(d. 1846) which stood until 1929, but I've not found anyone yet who knows the exact 
location of this. <br>
We will give you the gravestone location here, but I doubt the remains were 
moved with the tombstone slabs, so the cemetery is still there probably with 
some remaining parts of the monuments.&nbsp; <br>

From Athens go South on I 65 to the 565 Exit. Go east on I565 to the next exit (Exit 2) and 
take that right (south) into Mooresville Road. Go into Mooresville by crossing 
old Hwy 20/72 and go to East St and 
turn south (or right) and go one block and the Old Union Church is on your right 
at the NW corner of Lauderdale St. &amp; East St. Turn right (west) into Lauderdale 
St and park beside the church and walk the rest of the way into the church yard 
being careful not to trample the ornamental vegetation.<br>

This aerial view uses labels to depict the various places near the monuments of 
Adams Cemetery #2. The road labeled as 71 is actually East St. According to the 
road map below it becomes Broad St. later.<br>

This main purpose of this map is to show you the old Hwy 20 or the place where 
the William K. Adams home and cemetery might have stood. The home stood until 1929 and 
the cemetery monuments (part of) were moved in 1980. I have drawn the old Hwy 20 
as a red line east/west so the home was along that red lined route somewhere. More than 
likely the home was near the town of Mooresville and as you can see the little 
village is depicted here with Hwy 20 on the north side of the village. <br>
In olden times we would have 
found a bustling &amp; thriving settlement with banks and tradesman of all kinds 
serving the public. Mooresville is the oldest town in Alabama and prior to about 
1816 it was a part of the Mississippi Territory and this was in the county of Madison. 
The town sprang up as a off-load &amp; restocking place for the settlers floating down the Tennessee 
River from East Tennessee and North Carolina. Some stayed and 
others moved on north and south depending on their final destinations. Alabama 
was given statehood in 1820 and later this area split off to be a part of Limestone 
County Alabama when that county was formed. <br>
<font color="#000080">I have drawn red lines and cross bars along Hwy 
20 to show the area where the home most likely was located. When the railroads 
came along this little village became very sleepy while the rails bypassed it to 
the north a couple of miles at Belle Mina.<br>
The home was probably east of High St. at one time along Hwy 20.</font><br>
