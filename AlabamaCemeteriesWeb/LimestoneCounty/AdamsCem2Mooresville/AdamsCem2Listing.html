<b>**Full name was as given by Linda Smith in &quot;Tombstone Inscriptions of 
Limestone Co. Al.&quot; - It is not on the tombstone.</b></p>
<p><b>* Dr. William Kelsey Adams was the son of John (1770 - Sep 24, 1829) and 
Margaret Kelsey Adams, who were married on &quot;Big Limestone&quot; in Washington Co., 
Tenn. in 1790. Margaret the mother died in Huntsville. Ala. in 1821 and John lived at South 
Port, Franklin Co., Ala. at the time of his death. Dr.
William Kelsey Adams was born Feb 1, 1795 in Jonesboro, Tenn., practiced medicine 
in Mooresville until his death on July 8, 1846. He was an original trustee of 
the Cumberland Presbyterian Church here. His descendant, Robert Donnell 
Adams of San Antonio, Tx., was present at the unveiling of the historical marker 
(<a href="IMG_2037.JPG">Side 1</a>)/(<a href="IMG_2038.JPG">Side 2</a>) 
at the church in November, 1979. Robert was the descendant most responsible for 
keeping the knowledge of this cemetery alive.<br>
<br>
*
There were eight children born to Dr. William K. and Sophia Brown Adams. The remaining children 
not shown in the listing above are: Benjamin Franklin (Jan. 6, 1828 - ca 1874); Edward 
Alexander (Feb 16, 1830 - Mar 29, 1865); James Wyatt (Sep 21, 1832 - Oct 28, 
1890), ancestor of Robert Donnell Adams; Mary Agnes (Finnin) (Dec 6, 1837 - May 
9, 1905); and Minor Preston (Mar 7, 1840 - June 10, 1861). They all migrated to Texas after the death of their parents. Dr. Kelsey, his 
wife, and the three children buried here, all died of consumption contracted by 
Dr. Kelsey from his medical practice, and from a patient. <br>

<b><i>This Cemetery presentation is based on the photography of C. Wayne Austin, 
2 Mar 2015. Uploaded here by the same 
on 3 Feb 2015. It was also presented in the book Tombstone Inscriptions of Limestone County Alabama by Linda 
H. Smith. She did not find it, but partially listed it on Page 1 in 1991, with 
good genealogy information from another source. Findagrave has the 
cemetery and genealogy well listed but the tombstones are not generally 
readable, due to poor photo quality. However as you can see above these tombstones are almost beyond reading 
from having weathered away. At last notice some of the tombstones were misplaced to 
the listing. Also they gave us no map to know where these monuments were located.</i></b></p>
