From Athens travel north out Hwy 127&nbsp; 11 + miles. Just before the road 
bends sharply northwest there is a long residential road called Bucks Hollow Way 
to a house that is back into the area where the cemetery is found. You will be 
in the trees and traveling downhill on Hwy 127 at the turn off to the right into 
this long driveway. The driveway is under the trees, long and steep in places so 
travel with caution &amp; keep to the left. Stop at the house for permission and the 
cemetery then can be found by going down into the creek valley past the house 
and across the creek. The cemetery is on your left as you are climbing a hill on 
the field road up from the creek. There is a gate into the field past the creek. 
You must go thru that with permission from the folks back at the mentioned house 
on the rise in the clearing.</b><b>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="SmithCemAerial.jpg" width="1024" height="473"><br>
This aerial view above
shows the cemetery located in the small clump of trees on a knoll up above the 
creek and cattle pond.<br>
