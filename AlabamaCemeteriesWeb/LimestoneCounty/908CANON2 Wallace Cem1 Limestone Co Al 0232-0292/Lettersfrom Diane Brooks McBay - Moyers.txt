Thanks Diana I will keep all your thoughts you made below and probably add them to my Rootsweb Cemetery publication of the Wallace Cem if that is permissable.

 The two Sallie Moyers monuments, one is my great great grandmother, Sarah Jane "Sallie" Jones Moyers 1818-1897 (Find A Grave Memorial# 23837474) and the other is her daughter... Sarah Pauline "Sallie" Moyers Rector 1845-1912... if this is the one you are referring to, yes,  I entered her in the Wallace Cemetery on findagrave.com on January 8, 2008(Find A Grave Memorial# 23837475). She is the only daughter that has her husband buried in the same cemetery as she... her husband was a CSA soldier named Jesse Rector, 1840-1906 (Find A Grave Memorial #23837476). There are two more daughter's buried in Wallace Cemetery Nancy K "Nannie K" Moyers 1850-1908, she was a twin to my great grandfather Rufus Sherrill Moyers (buried in Tanner Cemetery). Nannie K was the second wife of Henry H Baker and so when he died he was buried next to his first wife Martha Moon Baker in the Ripley Cemetery. The other daughter was Elizabeth E Moyers Preston 1854-1899 (Find A Grave Memorial# 23837473) She married W H Preston 1857-1921 and died 20 years before he died, he remarried to Rosa Webb and when he died Rosa I guess buried him where she wanted him to be buried....Rosa died in 1935 and is buried in the Ripley Cemetery.
 I know where all of the children of Wyley and Sallie Jones Moyers are buried but two... Cassandra Moyer/Moyers she died as a young girl and I have not located her grave in East TN nor have I found a death date either. Last found in the 1860 census as a teen... not listed in the 1870 census. Can't find her married in the 1870 census living near her family nor a marriage of a girl her age and name in any county in East TN either. Therefore assuming she passed away between the 1860 and 1870 census times....and John Thomas Moyers.... the last known address was the 1880 census where he was living as a farm hand with a family in Limestone County, Alabama. My aunt said she remembered my granddaddy talking of his Uncle John coming from Madison County, Alabama in or around the Harvest/Toney area... for a visit but when I tried to find a John Moyers that would fit his age in Madison County, Alabama there were too many to pin point the right one. This was a few years ago and every now and then I try again hoping that some more records have been added to ancestry but haven't fell upon anything yet.

 When Wyley lived in East TN with his mother they went by the spelling Moyer but in his later years they said Wyley added the s to the end of his surname.
 The pictures of the Wallace Cemetery monuments of my Moyers family were taken by Ross and Gayle Smith. Gayle and I shared the same aunt when we were growing up... she was the daughter of my aunt's brother. My aunt was the sister in law to my mother.... Gayle and Ross were so generous as to share them privately with me first so that I might add them to their memorials... they also went to the Weir-Blair Cemetery, they live near by and knew the owners who gave them permission to go back to the river to the cemetery. At the time there was a fallen tree on one of the stones. Ross had said he was going to see if he could get that taken care of... I have never asked if he did or not.
 Well taken up enough time of yours with my babbling... thank you again... keep working, you get there....

have photographed the Wallace Cem you are talking about but am behind on publishing it. I do have the two Sallie Moyers monuments, but see you have added your ancestor but not the other one which is probably her daughter.
No ever been to the Weirs-Blair Cem but I know where it is and it is way off the beaten path. next to Elk River on a bluff top.

Wayne,
Thanks for the links...
No, as far as I know I am not related to the Moyers in Moyers Cemetery on Hwy 110, although it is not too far from my home.

I am originally from Tanner, Limestone County, Alabama... I am related to the Moyers in the Tanner Methodist Church Cemetery and others located in Roselawn Cemetery on Hwy 52... My mother was Edna Vivian Moyers married to Bobbie Brooks of Limestone County, Alabama. Mother and dad split long before I was old enough to know what a dad was... raised by a single mom on my grandparents farm, A W and Pinkie B Stewart Moyers of Tanner. Mom taught school at East Limestone, we only lived one mile from Tanner school so I went there all 12 years.
I met and married a Lincoln County, Tennessee boy and after mom died in 1980 we sold her place and moved to his home town and here we are still today... I have tried hard to link the Moyers of Lincoln County, Tennessee to the Moyers of Limestone Co. Alabama but have not done so as of yet.
But if you ever run across any cemetery documentation that has a Wyley Moyers born 1818 died 1872 I sure would like to know where he is buried... none of my family has found him. Family lore has it that he and his family came down river from East TN (Rhea Co) on a barge. The river was low and the barge got stuck in the mud somewhere around Limestone County.... for some reason my aunt thought it was Ditto Landing but that is in Madison Co... anyway... the family got off the barge and settled in Limestone Co. I am assuming close to the river as my great grandmother Sarah Jane Jones Moyers aka Sallie is buried in Wallace Cemetery over close to Clements area of Limestone County, Alabama. She died 25 years after her husband Wyley. Three of her daughters and one of her son in law's are buried there as well. But there is no marker for Wyley... my aunt also said that he got sick and died on the barge and was buried along the river. I sometimes think he may have been buried in the Weir Blair Cemetery which is located on private property and inactive... back in the day there was about 150 graves there but now there are only about 7 stones erect...some are broken and lying up against a tree they say... in 1993 when Linda H Smith was compiling her Tombstone Inscriptions of Limestone Co Alabama my Uncle William Wiley Moyers read the Stewart Cemetery for her... while doing so he heard about the Weir Blair Cemetery and went to see it with the owner's permission. He and his son in law found the broken stones and pieced some together, found on that had MOY on it but that was it... my uncle thought it was his great grandfather Wyley Moyers. It could be because of the connection... Wyley's son Rufus Sherrill Moyers married Mary Frances "Fannie" Weir daughter of Leonard Lindsay and Susan Young Weir. Susan was a midwife and sometimes worked for old Dr. Blair who had a hospital on his land on the river and the cemetery is on his land behind the hospital. When TVA was working on the river they needed part of the cemetery and they moved some graves but I don't know where they moved them to or if there was a list of names or what.  Anyway, if you ever run across a list for Weir-Blair Cemetery or Wyley Moyer/Moyers name on a burial list would you please be kind enough to shout out at me?
Thanks and keep up the good work, love it that there are some that are documenting the old for our descendants before the old disappears!

I finished the Withers Cemetery on my site so the public can now see all the photos if you are interested. Yes this is a story of trashing our heritage big time from destroying the old antebullem home to not taking care of the cemetery.
I take pride in visiting places like this as I enjoy what others seem to ignore, but I only think of the stones. Not interested in the details of the graves:

I will keep the Moyers in mind. Think they left town or are buried in unmarked graves or just don't know? Oh so you are related to that old Moyers Cemetery along Hwy 110.

Thanks for letting me know... I thank you for taking photos of the memorials I listed. I don't think I am related to anyone in the cemetery, unless it would the Jones .... however, I can't tell because I only know that my great great grandmother was Sarah Jane Jones and do not know her parents or any one related to her before marrying my great great grandfather Wyley M Moyers in 1832...
 I entered the memorials from Withers Cemetery from the book I own called Tombstone Inscriptions of Limestone County, Alabama that was compiled by Linda H Smith in 1993.... If there are any that you would like transferred please feel free to ask.
Thanks again for letting me know about finding the new grave... It really breaks my heart that there are so many inactive cemeteries out there that are not taken care of... one is too many!

I have visited the Withers Cemetery and made photos of this God awful jungle and I found an inscription that Linda missed. It was for this:

WITHERS, John Wright, 1796 - 12 Mar 1836.
WITHERS, Palmyra Jordan, w/o John Wright Withers, 10 Mar 1806 - 16 Aug 1864



Visit here if interested:

I added the photo of the tombstone also but will add the others in this site within a day or two where I work:
