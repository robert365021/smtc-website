From Athens go east toward Huntsville on Hwy 72 several miles to Mooresville 
Road (French's Mill community) and turn south (right). Go several miles to 
historic Mooresville Alabama (passing over I-65) and turn left at the &quot;T&quot; in the road and then turn 
back right on Broad Street continuing south in Mooresville. Follow that thru downtown 
Mooresville until it dead ends. After the pavement ends in the winter park your 
vehicle and you will cross the (low) gate and walk to this cemetery. Follow the gravel 
road as it curves around several hundred (about 500) yards and you will see the 
stone signage on your right for the cemetery.<br>
