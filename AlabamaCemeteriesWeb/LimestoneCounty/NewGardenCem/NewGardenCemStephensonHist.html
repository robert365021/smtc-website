<font color="#800000">I believe that Asa Newton Stephenson was the son of my 
Samuel Stephenson and his wife Mary Shields. On the 1820 census of Giles Co, TN, 
Samuel had two sons under five years old.<br/>
My belief is based on the old diary left by James C. 
Elliott. He mentions in his diary James Harvey Stephenson, son of Samuel 
Stephenson b.1796 and Mary Shields and Samuel Stephenson b. 1839<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From Rev. James C. Elliott's diary: <br/>

those attending were Mary P. Rambolt(Rambo) and Laura
Ann Locke.<br/>

Dec. 1872 - Elizabeth Moore came home with me.<br/>
Dec. 1872 - Went top Eliz. Stephensons.<br/>
Dec 1872 - Came to Sam Stephens (Stephenson's) all night, he gave pair of
socks and coat.<br/>

Jan 21, 1873 - Came to Sam Stephenson's before dinner, stayed
all evening - he came home after midnight!<br/>
Jan 22, 1873 - At Sam Stephenson's place, he gave me some tobacco and
medicine, then came home.<br/>

Stephenson's, stopped a while--<br/>

I believe John Curry who died in 1887 was the son of a Henry Curry and Lucinda 
who show up on the 1850 census of Limestone and census records of Giles <br/>
County, TN, but I can't be sure as there were several John Currys' born about 
the same time.<br/>
Betty Curry 1869-1916 above was the daughter of Samuel Stephenson 1839-1906 and 
Evaline Bradshaw <br/>

All are buried in the New Garden Cemetery in Limestone Co,Al. Betty Stephenson 
Curry was the wife of Tom Curry 1865-1941 above. Samuel David Stephenson 
1838-1906 was the son of Asa Newton Stephenson and wife <br/>
Elizabeth Elliot. I believe Asa Newton Stephenson was the son of Samuel 
Stephenson 1796-ca. 1860 who appears on the 1820 census of Giles with two boys  
under ten.<br/>
Samuel Stephenson 1796-ca. 1860 had a son James H. Stephenson who married Martha 
Montgomery in Limestone Co,Alabama in 1852. The son of James H. Stephenson  
b.1826 in Limestone Co,Al, had a son John Morgan Stephenson who married Sallie 
J. Curry, daughter of Allen Curry and Emily of Giles Co,TN.<br/>
The death certificate of Sallie J. Curry Stephenson in Ellis County, TX has that 
she was born 10 Dec 1855 in TN to Allen and Emily Curry.<br/>
If anyone has additional information on Allen Curry and 
John Curry, it would be greatly appreciated. Were Allen and John Curry related? 
What were the maiden names of the wives of John and Allen Curry?<br/>
