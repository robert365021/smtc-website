Athens Alabama travel Hwy 120 NE out of Athens and merge north Veto Road. Go 
about 2 and 1/2 miles and turn right on Robinson Road. Travel that until the 
bridge across the creek is ahead of you. After permission stop there and go 
south climbing up the hill going southward and across the pasture. This is about 
a 500 foot climb, mildly in some places and steeply in others up the slope, The 
whole distance is about a half mile. It is more like a mountain climbing 
expedition than a cemetery visit, so don't risk it if you are not capable. After 
much huffing and puffing you will eventually spot in the distance at nearly the 
top of the hill two intersecting tree lines. The cemetery is in the junction of 
those two tree line. This is a small private family cemetery so please get 
permission and this should give you access from Veto Road as there is a cart 
path leading west away from the cemetery.</font>&nbsp;<br>
