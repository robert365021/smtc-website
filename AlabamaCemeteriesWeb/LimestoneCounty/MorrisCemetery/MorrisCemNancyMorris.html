<br>
Wife of S. (Shadrick) Morris; (nee Allen) Daughter of Joseph Pruitt &amp; Leah Moss 
Pruitt; born in North Carolina, (Same place as husband, Shadrick Morris), and 
both died in Limestone, AL.<br>
<br>
The marriage of Shadrick Morris and Nancy Pruitt Allen occurred in Feb 1824 in 
North Carolina; this was the 2nd marriage for each of them. He was previously 
married to Elizabeth Hutchins and Nancy was previously married to Thomas Allen. 
That is why her surname is given as &quot;Allen&quot; on the marriage record. <br>
Her full name should thus be Nancy Pruitt Allen Morris.<br>

From Barbara Miller 13 Feb 2015:<br>
Are you certain the death date reads 1850 and not 1854 on tomb rock? I found 
Nancy Morris (64), living with her son, Lewis (30) &amp; grandson John P. on the 30 
October 1850 U.S. Federal Census in Athens, AL.<br>
<br>

______________________<br>
Barbara, 1850 is what I see on the tombstone, but that can be in error. Linda 
Smith of the book Tombstone Inscriptions of Limestone Co also found the death 
year to be 1850. CWA 17 Feb 2015, <br>

1850 Census of 30 Oct 1850, Dist 4, HH#54, Limestone Co., Ala.<br>
Morris, Lewis, 30 NC (Son of Nancy)<br>
Morris, John, 18 AL (Grandson of Nancy)<br>
Morris, Nancy 64 NC (This shows Nancy alive after the death date specified by 
the tombstone. Barbara's challenge above says the death year was 1854, as 
specified by the family records/research of Barbara Miller of Tennessee 18 Feb 
2015.<br>
_____________________<br>
<br>
I will leave the death year as 1850 according to the tombstone, but you may now 
use 1854 and be sure that is accurate for your records.<br>
