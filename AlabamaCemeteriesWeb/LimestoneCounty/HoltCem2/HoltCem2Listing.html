Here you should find one double 
obelisk stone with two graves and one military marker 
for John W. Holt. 
Also a child is said to be buried here as relayed to Linda Smith from Myrtle Haggermaker 
in the 1990s.<br>
The story is told in the Holt family that this cemetery was founded in 1872 when 
Martha died. At that time a rain storm flooded the Piney Creek and it was out of 
its banks and they were unable to get across it to take her remains to the old Holt Family Cemetery 
#1 on Hwy 31/Hwy 251. So they buried Martha northeast and behind the Cabin. 
Maybe the child died about the same time or after Martha and was theirs. Years 
later when John W. Holt died they added his remains here beside his wife.<br>
