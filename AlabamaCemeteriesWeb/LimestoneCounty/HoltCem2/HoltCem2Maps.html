From Athens travel I-65 north to Exit 361 and go east a mile or so to Thach and cross the 
railroad tracks and immediately turn right (or south) on Holt Road. Follow that 
about 3.25 miles to Black Road and turn right. Go a long mile crossing Piney Creek 
and afterward turn left on Yarbrough Rd. Go to the first lane which may now be a farm lane 
or a residential road and with permission follow that back to the cemetery about 
300 yards from due east of Yarbrough Rd. This property after more than a Century is no 
longer in the hands of the Holt family members. The new owners are now nervous 
about folks coming into their property. So go here only with permission and with 
the intent not to disturb anything. That means do not disturb any livestock. 
Make no ruts in the roads or fields. Break down no fences or gates. As I always 
say if you happen upon a $10 gold coin leave it alone it is not yours or at 
least get it to the owner. Well you get the jest of this. <br>

This aerial view above
shows the cemetery located behind the log house but that could change if the 
cemetery is moved out of here or the cabin is changed.<br>
