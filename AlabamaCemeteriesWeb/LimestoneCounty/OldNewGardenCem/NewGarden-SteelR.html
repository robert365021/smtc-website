</font>Wayne, I am glad you found the location of the Montgomery 
Cemetery down from the New Garden. There seemed to be a small hill in the 
background behind the tombstone. After I read your message and mention of the 
New Garden Cemetery, I started thinking about the parents of James Gibson 
Montgomery's second wife Mary Steele. I checked to see if you had them listed in 
the Old New Garden Cemetery, and you did, but the tombstones are in sad shape 
for folks that were so prominent in our early history.<br/>
<br/>
I checked the book " Archibald Steele and His Descendants "by Newton Chambers 
Steele. Mary Steele Montgomery's parents were Robert Steele and Martha Starr 
Steele so that shows they are interred there.<br/>
<br/>
Robert Steele was born Sept. 7, 1767 in Lancaster Co., Pennsylvania and died 
January 9,1854 near Elkmont, Limestone County, Alabama. Robert Steele's obituary 
was printed in the Banner of Peace in Nashville,TN. It is shown at this link:<br/>

<b>He moved with his father Archibald Steele to York Co, SC in 
1772. In 1817 he moved his family from York Co., SC to Madison Co., Al. In April 
of 1820, the New Garden Congregation was organized in his barn and Robert Steele 
was one of the ruling Elders.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the Limestone County Historical Association knows about Robert 
Steele and his colorful history?<br/>
<br/>
The book Archibald Steele and his Descendants can be found at this website 
called Open Liberty and off to the right side of the page is "read online"<br/>
