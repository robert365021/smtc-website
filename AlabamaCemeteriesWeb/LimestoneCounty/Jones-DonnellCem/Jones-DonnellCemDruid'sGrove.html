My name is Betty Bolin Brown and I am from Shreveport, Louisiana, but I am 
working on a project in Marshall, Texas. My ggg grandfather and many others who 
moved through Limestone/Madison counties and then Tennessee founded a Cumberland 
Presbyterian Church about eight miles south of Marshall, in Harrison County, 
Texas. My ggg grandfather gave land for a cemetery and I am a member of a 
committee for the Cemetery that is attempting to develop a general history for 
the area and specific genealogy for each individual buried � which is somewhere 
between 150 � 200. (Ground penetrating radar and old records indicate more 
burials than markers.)<br>
<br>
Some of my ancestors moved from Caswell County, NC to Limestone/Madison Counties 
in Alabama (Jones, Adair, Wilder � info attached above &quot;Druid's Grove&quot;) and 
Collier, Craig, Yancey through Giles/Fayette Counties in Tennessee. (William 
Craig, the youngest of several children remained in Giles County, Alabama). My 
direct ancestors moved on to Harrison County, Texas.<br>
<br>
During the Civil War, several of the units from Harrison County were at Fort 
Donelson. One of the units had many Cumberland Presbyterians, including two 
Craig brothers and Christopher Columbus Ellis, whose mother was an Alexander who 
had lived in Giles County. Official records indicate Christopher Columbus Ellis 
was killed during the battle at Ft. Donelson, but family records show he died in 
Giles County two weeks later. I found Christopher Columbus buried in the Yokley 
Cemetery, with his marker still standing a few years ago when pictures in the 
website below were made. (Christopher Columbus Ellis� mother was an Alexander 
and I recognize names of her relatives in this cemetery.) <br>
<br>
<br>
I believe that James Marion Craig, or his brother Thomas Hatley Craig escaped 
and brought Christopher Columbus back to his mother�s family. I am hoping that 
someone in Giles County may know what happened. Maybe someone associated with 
the Cemetery or the Cumberland Presbyterian Church may remember this interesting 
story? Any help you can provide in solving this mystery would be appreciated!<br>
