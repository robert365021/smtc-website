</b> &nbsp;This old log house was built by Levi Cummings, probably before 1810 making it the 
oldest home in Limestone County before it was burned by arsonist/vandals in 
about 2003. It was located on a small ridge a couple hundred yards west from the 
Cummings Cemetery. From the look, it appears this was a shotgun house and the 
center part was later enclosed. These are old hand hewn logs. The ones on the 
base spanned the entire width of the house. They could very well be American 
Chestnut logs an extinct tree.<br>
<br>
Cliff Cumins has two pictures of the old log house that his mother took 
with a Polaroid camera in the early 80ï¿½s.
<br>
In 2005, Cliff Cumins, his wife, and Mother went back to see the place. A local 
man who has lived in the area all his life, took them to the house place. The 
man said that a couple years prior to this, the present owners, who were 
planning on restoring it, had refused to let some deer hunters camp there. That 
night they, or someone else, burned the place. When Cliff was there he walked 
all around the place and there was no doubt that there had been a fire with 
several partially burned logs remaining in place.<br>
<br>
Cliff's last name is spelled CUMINS, because his granddad misspelled the 
surname. The granddad's brothers and sisters spelled their name CUMMINS. Many of 
the other relatives spelled the name like it is here in the cemetery,&nbsp; 
CUMMINGS. The story related to him by my Dad was that Levi Cummings/Cummins had 
moved into this area, homesteaded and built this house. At the time, the area 
was considered to be Indian territory and the Governor of Tennessee sent troops 
there and forced everyone to move. It is believed that Levi was one of those 
encroaching on Indian Lands who had to move. Also about 20 miles southeast from 
this site stood Fort Hampton, the only Fort built by the US Government devoted 
to keeping the American Settlers from encroaching on native Indian lands. We are 
not privy to the details of how this affected Levi Cummings but know sometime 
after 1810 he was back living here with his growing family. <br>
<br>
Thank you, Cliff Cumins. <br>
