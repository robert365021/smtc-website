															This cemetery is 
															actually in 
															Limestone County, 
															Alabama, but at one 
															time before 1817 
															this would have been 
															a part of Madison Co 
															AL and even in 
															earlier times a part 
															of the Mississippi 
															Territory. Also this 
															cemetery is  
															associated with the 
															oldest white 
															settlers&nbsp;in Alabama 
															though the marked 
															burials are not as 
															such. These folks 
															probably floated 
															down the Tennessee 
															River from NC to get 
															here and walked up 
															the old Mooresville 
															(northbound) Trail, 
															a few miles to the 
															west of this 
															cemetery.</div>
														<div>
															These so called 
															descendants of Adam 
															Clem did not move. 
															Limestone County 
															Alabama was formed 
															about 1815 to 1820 
															(don't remember 
															exact time) so that 
															is why Madison Co 
															and Limestone Co are 
															both mentioned 
															below.</div>

&nbsp;<p><tt>We are searching for information pertaining to the CLEM and

																<br clear="none">
																Adam Clem 
																married circa 
																1784 to Jemima 
																CROCKETT...they 
																were in Elbert 
																County, GA 1790, 
																Burke County, NC 
																1800, Bedford

																In 1805 Adam

																<br clear="none">
																Descendants of

																Limestone 
																County, Alabama, 
																which adjoins 
																Giles County, TN 
																to the north 
																where in 1830 a

																Any info on the

																<br clear="none">
																Archibald 
																Crockett b. 1774 
																had a daughter

																married Jacob 
																Cochran in Giles 
																County, TN,
																<font color="#996633">
																and died in Polk 
																Co MO 1865,&nbsp; 
																but this is a 
																different Jemima 
																Crockett. 
																Perhaps the

																Jemima is a daughter 
																of the Archibald 
																Crockett of Va &amp; 
																Mecklenburg Co 
																NC who is 
																thought to be 
																the grandfather

																However the
