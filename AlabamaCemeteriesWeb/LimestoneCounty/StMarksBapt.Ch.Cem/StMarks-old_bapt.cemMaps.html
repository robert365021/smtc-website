With this map we see the GPS coordinates also known as the Longitude and 
Latitude of the St Marks or Old Baptist Church Cemetery.

        This says the GPS is 34.4356 X 86.9913 parked 
50 feet due south of the graves:

Go north from Elkmont on Hwy 127 for 1/2 mile north from Fort Hampton Road (CR 
49) and turn left on Annie Lane. Go 4 tenths of a mile into the woods, but 
before the road turns to a locked gate, look to your right and if the woods 
are clear you will see the stones, unless they have all fallen. 
Otherwise get out of your vehicle and search for the stones.<br>

This aerial map from Google shows the cemetery just inside the tree line on the 
right of Annie Lane.<br>
This is the location commentary from the cemetery book: SW quarter of 
SW quarter, Sect. 19, T1S, R4W, west of Hwy. 127.<br>
This cemetery is off a dirt road next to a field and is rapidly becoming 
overgrown. It appears to be a very large cemetery although most graves are 
marked with fieldstones. Many sinks are evident. There is some question as to 
whether this is St. Mark's Cemetery that is on the county map. Copied Oct. 12, 
1988 by Linda &amp; Sheryl Smith.<br>
