CEMETERY, Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, LIMESTONE COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<br>
</font></b></font>Samuel Cox was born around 1797 in Kentucky and died around 
1851 in Limestone County, Alabama. He married Charity Manning, daughter of 
Pridgen Manning and Mary Batchelor. Charity Manning was born in Nash County, 
North Carolina around 1803. Charity and some of her children moved to the Spring 
Hill Township of Hempstead Co. Arkansas in the late 1850s and she likely died 
there. She can be found on the 1860 federal census in the Springhill Township of 
Hempstead Co., Ar. but can't be found at a later date.<br>
Children of Samuel Cox and Charity Manning<br>
It is not known for sure if Samuel is buried in this Cemetery but it reasonable 
to believe he could be since it is near where he lived in 1851, has the Cox 
family name along with graves from the same time period when Samuel died.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Charity Cox paid land taxes in 1869, probably in October. The taxes were paid on 
80 acres, West 1/2 of the SW 1/4, (WSW), Sec. 26, T14S, R24W, Hempstead County, 
Arkansas. This info was found on Roll 77, Indexed 1007497, SW Ark. Archives,
