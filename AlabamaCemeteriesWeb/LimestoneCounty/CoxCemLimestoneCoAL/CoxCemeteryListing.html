MADREY, 1913 (not found)<br/>
<br/>
<b>COX CEMETERY RELOCATION REPORT IN FILES OF 
BROWN'S PERRY NUCLEAR PLANT FROM TVA (TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY)<br/>
<br/>
  Maps and Surveys Branch was notified July 22, 1966, that the Cox 
Cemetery, the only known cemetery on the Brown's Ferry Nuclear Plant site in 
Limestone County, Alabama, near Athens, would have to be moved because it was 
within the construction area.<br/>
  Preparation began immediately for the execution of the cemetery 
relocation program that was established with the Norris Project and is described 
in the Manual for Grave Relocation Activities of June, 1948.<br/>
  The cemetery, originally number 63 in Wheeler Reservoir, was re-mapped 
Mar. 14, 1962, showing thirteen (13) graves as in 1935. Of these thirteen 
graves, six were marked with four monuments: Col. Bartley Cox, John B. Cox &amp; 
Robert I. Cox (marked with one monument engraved on two sides), Eliza J. and 
Mary A. Cox (marked with one monument engraved on two sides) and Mabelle Lang. 
One grave had the name Madrey shown on the original map. After talking with 
people in the area no additional names could be obtained for any of the other 
graves.<br/>
<br/>
  The job of trying to trace the descendants of the Bartley Cox family, 
Mabelle Lang and Madrey began. The Bartley Cox family was traced up to 1894, at 
which time the only direct descendants were living in Arkansas and, as far as 
could be ascertained, none ever returned to the area. There are several Cox 
families in the area but none of them can claim any kin to the Col. Bartley Cox 
family. No relatives of Madrey could be located. We finally located a brother of 
Mabelle Lang, John A. Lang, whose address is 409 Oak St., Sylacauga, Alabama. He 
was contacted and the relocation discussed with him. He was agreeable and a 
permit was prepared and sent to him for signature. He informed us that he has a 
sister, Mrs. Mary Bonds, living at Valhermoso Springs, Alabama. She was also 
contacted, agreed to the relocation and signed a permit. All this was 
accomplished only after an exhaustive search that lasted for over a month.<br/>
  In August, 1966, an investigative survey was made for additional graves 
that might be in the cemetery. Twenty (20) possible grave locations were spotted 
and added to the map making a total of possible thirty-three (33) to be moved.<br/>
  Due to the fact that there were possibly twenty- 6) graves of completely 
unknown origin, it was not possible to get permission to reinter any of them in 
a local church, public or private cemetery- We were then directed by Federal 
Court order that they would be reinterred (all of them) in a location on Federal 
property. There was a possible cemetery shown on land acquisition map 
67MS421P501-R2. Upon investigation of this area, no graves, or knowledge of 
burials were found; therefore this was proposed as the site of the Cox 
Reinterment Cemetery. This site is located in the Northeast corner of the 
Brown's Ferry Nuclear Plant property, beginning 235' West of the East boundary 
and 60' South of the North boundary (which is the centerline of the old Brown's 
Ferry-Huntsville Road) and being rectangular in shape 150' X 100', designated as 
Relocated Cox Cemetery No. R-1. This cemetery was divided into twenty-four (24) 
blocks having a capacity of eight graves each. (There follows a day-by-day 
description of reinterment from September 20-26.)<br/>
  The only four monuments were set in place in the reinterment cemetery 
this afternoon and sealed by a stone mason from the Florence Marble Works. The 
monument of Col. Cox was in four sections: (1) a cap Chat has an open book 
engraved with a verse, (2) a shaft engraved with name, date of death, age and a 
symbol of two interlocking triangles, (3) a square section of stone and (4) a 
base. The stone mason stated that the base was granite but all the other 
sections were Italian marble. It was learned that the verse on the cap was from 
the 1st degree of the Scottish Rite Masonry and the two interlocked triangles on 
the shaft denotes 32nd degree. The monument for Mary S Eliza and John &amp; Robert 
Cox were originally identical.<br/>
  September 29: Scraping operations were halted this morning in order that 
several soil discoloration spots could be checked. Scraping had been done to a 
depth of between four and five feet and had gone below a hard-pan of red clay. 
Eighteen (18) additional graves were located. These were undoubtedly buried at 
an earlier time than the group in the Cox family area because they were laid at 
an angle of approximately thirty degrees (30) North to them and the bottom of 
the graves were eight feet below the original surface of the cemetery...<br/>
  A total of fifty-one (51) graves were moved and reinterred at Cox 
Cemetery No. R-1 in fifteen (15) work-days, (128 man-days) of grave removal 
operation. Fifteen (15) of this total graves appear to have been children.</b></p>
<p><b>Col. Bartley Cox owned 
and operated the Brown's Ferry and a house for the accommodation of travelers 
crossing the Tennessee River at this place. <br/>
A 1915 TVA survey showed this cemetery contained approximately 11 graves. <br/>
Not sure where the name Browns came from as in Browns Ferry. Maybe someone named 
Brown had the ferry earlier or later than Colonel Bartley Cox.</b></p>
