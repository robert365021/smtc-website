I am searching for the first wife of James Gibson Montgomery known only as a 
Miss Shields whom he married somewhere in Tennessee and had two children by her. 
His
second wife was a Mary Steele who he married in Limestone County, Alabama about 
1823.
This (See below) is the source for the Miss Shields: <br/>
<br/>
1850 census of Limestone Co, Alabama:<br/>
James G. Montgomery age 70 b. NC.<br/>
Martha M. Montgomery, age 25 b. Alabama. She married James Harvey Stephenson, 
son of My Samuel Stephenson and Mary Shields in Limestone County, Alabama in 
1853.<br/>
Mary A. Montgomery, age 22 b. Alabama<br/>
David C. Montgomery, age 20 b. Alabama.<br/>
James Gibson Montgomery was the son of James Montgomery and Ann Woods from 
Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that James Gibson Montgomery might have been connected to the several 
Montgomerys' who settled early in Giles County, TN and were neighbors to the
Shields in the Elk Ridge community of Giles Co, TN. Many of which are buried in 
the Elk Ridge Cemetery. My Samuel Stephenson is on the 1820 census of Giles Co., 
TN. My Samuel Stephenson settled in Limestone Co., Alabama
in 1822.<br/>
Samuel Stephenson had a sister Margaret who married a James Montgomery in York 
Co, SC in 1817 and James Montgomery and his wife Margaret Stephenson went to
Giles Co,TN before 1820. After 1820 James Montgomery disappears. There is a book 
on line called "Archibald Steele and his Descendants" Mary Steele who married
James Gibson Montgomery is included in this book. The author of the Archibald 
Steele book claimed that James Gibson Montgomery's first wife was a Margaret
Stephenson. James Harvey Stephenson who married Martha M. Montgomery is also in 
the book. My Stephenson surname is spelled "Stepherson" in the Archibald Steele
book. Archibald Steele settled in York County, SC as did my Stephensons which 
included Samuel Stephenson.<br/>
George Alexander Stephenson, son of my Samuel Stephenson, is on the 1880 census 
of Limestone Co., Alabama. <br/>
James Gibson Montgomery is buried in the Montgomery Cemetery near Elkmont 
(actually behind New Garden Cemetery on New Garden Road).<br/>
James Harvey Stephenson and wife Martha Manerva Montgomery appear on the 1860 
and 1870 census of Giles Co, TN.<br/>

JAMES NEWTON MONTGOMERY was born in Limestone county, Ala., August 20, 1827.<br/>
His parents were James and Mary (Steele) Montgomery. The former was born in 
Mecklenburg county, N. C., and was of Scotch-Irish extraction. Mrs. Mary
Montgomery was born in South Carolina, though her father was born in Ireland. 
She was reared in South Carolina. Mr. Montgomery's father was twice married, his
first wife being a Miss Shields, whom he married in Tennessee, and by whom he 
had one son and one daughter. After her death her husband married Miss Steele in
Limestone county, Ala. To their marriage were born six children, four sons and 
two daughters, the mother dying when James Newton Montgomery was about three
years of age, and the father some twenty years later. James Newton Montgomery 
was reared on a farm, assisting his father, who was a farmer by occupation, but
who maintained a workshop on his farm where he made chairs and flax wheels. J. 
N. Montgomery received what was called an old field school education, his time
in boyhood being allotted, the summers to farm work and the winters to 
attendance at the old field schools. He started out in life for himself at the
age of twenty-one, and going to Pulaski, Tenn., secured a position cutting 
stone, at which trade he worked for two years. He then went to Columbia, Tenn.,
where he engaged in the same business for a similar period. In January, 1852, he 
came to Selma, (AL) when that now prosperous town was but a small village. For 
three
years he worked at marble-cutting as a journeyman and then at the same trade for 
one year in Montgomery. In 1856 he began business in Selma, as a marble dealer,
and continued in that business up to the time the war broke out, when he left 
his growing business in the charge of an employee and in September, 1861,
entered, as a second lieutenant, the service of the Confederacy, in company B., 
Twentieth Alabama regiment of infantry. In June of 1863, he was promoted to be
first lieutenant of his company at Fort Gibson, Miss. In 1863 he received a 
gun-shot wound in the right arm, in consequence of which he was retired in 1864
and assigned to conscript post duty in Shelby county, Ala., where he continued 
until the end of the war. He then returned to Selma and has there continued his
marble business ever since, his son W. R. Montgomery, becoming a partner in the 
firm in 1889. J. N. Montgomery &amp; Son are dealers in all kinds of Italian and
American marble, and imported and native granites of all kinds. They employ 
artistic workmen and turn out very satisfactory work, being both practical
workmen and therefore well able to judge of the quality of the work done by 
their men. In November, 1857, Mr. Montgomery married Miss Minerva Ferguson, who
was born and reared in Selma, Ala., and to their marriage five children have 
been born, three of whom are now dead. Mrs. Montgomery died in 1878. Mr.
Montgomery is a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian church, a master Mason and 
a member of the Knights of Honor.<br/>
