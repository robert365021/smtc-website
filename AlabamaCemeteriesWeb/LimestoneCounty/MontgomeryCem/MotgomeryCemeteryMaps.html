<b><font size="2">Directions to the Montgomery Cemetery Take I-65 to Exit no 
361 and go west on Sandlin Road to Hayes Mill Road. Go more than a mile and turn 
left on Hayes Mill or New Garden Road. At the New Garden Cemetery go down New Garden Road 
east until the woodland clears and the cemetery is about 200 yards south of the 
road into the woodland. This cemetery is in the edge of the woodland facing an 
open field looking east.<br>

With this Aerial View we see the New Garden Road which becomes County Road 98 
going east. You can park in the church parking lot, scale the bank across the 
road and follow the opening in the woodland to the cemetery. You must keep the eastern 
edge of the woods in your view as you scan for the two stones and one box tomb 
to the east (or your left).<br>
