<p><b>There are six to eight fieldstone marked 
graves believed to be for the former slaves of the Milhous family. They 
generally would have died before the Civil War 1861-1865, but some may have 
stayed with the Milhous family until death and their services paid for in 
monetary remuneration after being freed. The fieldstones are confusing to a 
novice because the perimeter of the cemetery is aligned with fieldstones each 
facing inward along the fence line as confirmed by Mr. Potts who voluntarily 
maintains this cemetery in a very meticulous manner. The descendents, of which I 
am not one of them, say thanks to the Potts family for their generosity. It is 
not known when the rock cemetery perimeter was first laid out. It is overlaid 
with the typical barbed wire fence complete with gates all installed by Mr. Potts. 
The cemetery premises juts out from his property and only the east side line 
connects to his property. An estimate of the area is about 30' X 100' In a 
conversation with Mr. Potts it was determined clearly that the rock fence was 
later overlaid a wire fence by himself and these are clearly the boundary of the 
cemetery.</b></p>
<p><b>There is a legend concerning an old family doctor interred in Milhous Cemetery 
that I have heard twice in my lifetime. Once back in 1967 while riding thru here 
from Muscle Shoals Al (on Old Hwy 31) on the way to Manchester Tennessee as told 
by Oscar Medley, and again recently by a farmer during 2009 from Elkton 
Tennessee. It says that at one time a family doctor, of the Milhous surname 
interred in this cemetery, built a private medical practice, which was so effective that 
he built a hospital here and operated it during his career to accommodate all 
the patients which came for his services. It it said 
the sick came from far and wide to be treated by him and stay in the hospital 
which doubled as a hotel. This version was found to be true recently when 
Rebecah Davis researched this question. Rebecah of the Limestone County 
Archives.** wrote an article about this in the Valley Star on page 18. I will 
condense it here. Its says among other interesting things that Joel Wooley a 
North Carolina transplant to the area discovered the Sulphur Springs a 1/2 mile 
to the east of this graveyard in about 1820 and proceeded to develope into a 
tourist site for the sick or others seeking to improve their health. A hotel was 
built to accommodate the&nbsp; visitors and the&nbsp; finest food accommodations 
of the day were served to the visitors. This business operated successful for 
many years. By 1881, Wooley decided to get out of the mineral springs business. 
He sold the estate to Dr. William A. Milhous and moved to the north-western part 
of Limestone County, but the springs kept his name, as it does to this day. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Soon Milhous also reported that he was 
having more applicants than he could accommodate. His solution was to build a 
saw mill nearby to help with the new buildings, and each summer would find a new 
building added to an existing one.<br>
When the final building was completed, the complex Included 30 guest rooms, 
dining and sitting rooms and a kitchen. Milhous Hotel operated at least through 
July 1916, when Dr. Milhous announced the season opening of Wooley Springs at $8 
per week or $30 a month.</b></p>
<p><b>Today, the Milhous Hotel is long gone, 
and a home stands on the site, but the legacy of Wooley Springs remains the name 
of the community along Ala. Hwy. 251 (Old Highway 31 Nashville to Birmingham) 
that boasts churches and more by that name. And if you search out the spring, 
who knows? You may still find healing in its waters!&quot;<br>
<br>
The question for us now is who is William A. Milhous in regards to the Milhous 
family in this graveyard . No doubt he is a third generation Milhous from John &amp; 
Anna. He is not buried here or at least does not have a tombstone. If you can 
solve this mystery we would like to hear from you</b><b> Please write to me.

I was doing some research recently and came across your website for our area 
cemeteries. In the article for Milhous cemetery, you mention the mystery of Dr. 
William A Milhous and requested additional information. I wish to provide the 
following information as possibilities:<br>
<br>
I traced census records from 1850 to 1920 for a William A Milhous. In 1850, a 
7-year old son (born about 1843) of John and Tabitha Milhous was listed as 
living in District 3, Limestone County, AL. In 1860, the family was listed in 
District 1 (Shoalford PO). By 1870, William&nbsp;&nbsp; was married (Susan 
(according to one online family tree, and Find A Grave, her maiden name was 
Holman)) with two children, and living Twp 1 Range 3 of Limestone Co. (this is 
the area around Wooley Springs). The 1880 census of the same area listed 
William, Susan and five children. Of course, the 1890 census is not available, 
and, so far, I have been unsuccessful in locating the family in 1900. In 1910, 
William's family were enumerated in the Sand Spring community which is centered 
just northwest of Wooley Springs. At this point, it was just William, Susan, a 
widowed daughter, Lucy, and a hired man named Lewis Turner. 1920 finds a widowed 
William living with daughter, Beatrice, and her family, the Reese's, in District 
8, Lincoln County, Tennessee. I believe William died in 1925 and is buried at 
Rose Hill Cemetery in Fayetteville, Tennessee, near Beatrice and her family. It 
appears that Susan is also buried there at Rose Hill, having died in July 1916 
in Nashville, Tenn.<br>
<br>
I hope this is helpful. Thank you, again, for the wonderful work on all the 
cemetery websites. <br>

Photos of the number series 56XX were made in a rain storm 
9 Mar 2010. A recent update (22 Apr 2012) thanks to the help of Virginia Taylor 
a descendent of John &amp; Anna Stewart Milhous has resulted in an opportunity for 
improved photos based on minor restoration and better weather. Number series 
16XX to 17XX.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;You must have permission from the Potts family to 
the west or the  </font>Mike 
Zanutto family to the south to visit this cemetery. The 
security of their livestock and home owner assets are involved in visiting this cemetery.&nbsp; 
Mike says: &quot;There is a driveway to 
the property in which I have an iron gate. I do expect privacy to the property 
and if anyone wishes access they should contact me directly at 
<a href="mailto:Znzmachine@yahoo.com">
Znzmachine@yahoo.com</a> 
before accessing the property.&quot; And I CWA might add I am sure Mike does not want 
his grass trampled down by vehicles or a trail of unexpected visitors.

From:
Virginia Rutledge Taylor</b></p>
<p><b>It was so good to meet you yesterday and I really appreciate your work on the 
gravestones.&nbsp; This is the information handed down to me about the Milhous 
family.<br>
<br>
&quot;John and Anna Stewart Milhous came to Limestone Co., AL around 1809. John's 
parents were Samuel and Katherine Jackson Milhous. The daughter of John and 
Anna, Mary (Polly) Milhous, married Charles Hodges. They were the parents of my 
great-grandmother, Susannah Hodges Rutledge. So John and Anna would be my 3rd 
great grandparents. <br>
My maiden name is Rutledge, and the Rutledges also came to Mississippi from 
Limestone County. All of my Great-grandfather Alfred's siblings were born in 
Limestone Co. Have you ever run across any Rutledge graves in a cemetery? I am 
sure someone died while they were all living there. <br>
A distant cousin, now deceased, said that John Milhous was a Quaker whose 
ancestor had brought papers from County Antrim, Ireland, in 1669. So that would 
explain why there is no no Revolutionary War records for John Milhous. They were 
Quakers. They were already in the country and wasn't John born in 1767 in SC?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Thanks again for your work and making the time to meet us. <br>
