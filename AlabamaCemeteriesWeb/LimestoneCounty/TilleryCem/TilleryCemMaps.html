With this map we see the GPS coordinates also known as the Longitude and 
Latitude of the Tillery Cemetery as N 34.97269 X W 86.78847. Alternate Location: 
In the center of the North East Quarter of Section 12, Township 1 South. Range 3 West on the south side of Davis Branch 
back in a field. The cemetery is just north of a TVA Utility right of way for 
the Electrical Towers, which hopefully will continue to provide a driving 
path to this cemetery far back into the woodland.<br>

Find this cemetery by following northeast the Hwy 53 (Ardmore Hwy) to Elkwood 
Section Road and turning right. Follow that for about a mile and turn south 
(right) into a white lime gravel field road used by TVA to inspect the utility 
Electrical Grid lines. After going thru a hedge of trees including a dry gulch 
continue following the road until you come under the utility towers. Continue to 
follow the utility inspection road west under the utility towers. After you come 
to the first set of poles go under that set and then another set and go another 
50 yards (150 feet) past the second towers and turn your vehicle due north 
(right 90 degrees) and head to the woodland 40 yards away. The cemetery is 
inside a woodland area about 10 yards into the woods and is easily seen in the 
winter, but can be found in the summer. There is an old hog wire fence around 
most of the cemetery. <br>

You begin your off road journey traveling south west of Elkwood Section Rd still 
inside Madison County Section 7 and cross into Section 12 of Limestone County 
where you will find the cemetery in the center of the Northeast Quad of section 
12. Eppy Tillery purchased one eighth of the Section 12, but if he records are 
correct the one south of this one below the 12 in the map above. He would have 
owned the 1/8 of the section one parcel west from the 1/8 section parcel next to 
the Madison/Limestone County lines as depicted in the above map drawn off in 
yellow areas.<br>
