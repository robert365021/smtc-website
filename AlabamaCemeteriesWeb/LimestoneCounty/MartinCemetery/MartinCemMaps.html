Directions from Athens take Highway 72 west. Go past Mooresville Road to 
Bradford Road. Turn right (or south) on 
Bradford Road. Go the top of the hill of junction of Cedar Break Trail Rd. (on 
the left) terminates into Bradford Road. That is about 500 yards back from where 
the road bends 90 degrees back to the west.&nbsp; Look west (or right) out into the 
field about 300 yards to a clump of trees surrounded by the field. That grove of 
trees contains the cemetery.</span><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><br>

With this map we see the grove of trees out in the big field where the 
cemetery is located. We have it pointed out with a red check. With permission 
and no crops to trample on there are times of the year that one can drive out 
there given it is dry and not muddy.<br>

View standing at the Junction of Bradford Road &amp; Cedar Break Trail. The clump in 
the center of the photo is the cemetery. The field road needed to get to this 
cemetery is on the left not in this view. This is a rather large cemetery spread 
out over the whole tree infected area of about 2 acres.<br>
