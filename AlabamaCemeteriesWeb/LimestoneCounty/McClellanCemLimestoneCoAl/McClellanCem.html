This cemetery contains the remains of the McClellan family who are known by me
to be the in-laws of Sue Strong McClellan West
who married David K. West of Giles County Tennessee. Sue was married to the William C. McClellan who died in 1869
and was interred here just after the Civil War. He served
the Confederate Army as a Private in Company H. 9th Alabama Infantry. Sue then
married David K. West.&nbsp;<br>
The cemetery has a chain link fence around it and has three visible
monuments there. One as mentioned for William C McClellan 1839 - 1869, a
Confederate Vet. A very large monument installed in the last 100 years to his
parents. Also another memorial for someone who died in May 22, 1859. The top is
lost. based on that date I have assigned it to the Martha L. McClellan.</b></font>

The death date and the epitaph is the only part of the inscription left. I can count about 7
to 10 graves but we find inscriptions for four people in this cemetery and this stone obviously marks one of them. The tree
that it stands near is not necessarily the original place for this stone. Source
of text for this listing in parenthesis: Tombstone Inscriptions of Limestone
County Alabama, Linda Smith, Transcriber, 4 Feb 1990, published 1993.

<br>
David K. West was the son of <b> Samuel &amp; Minerva Samuels West</b> of Blue Branch,
(Dist 14) Giles County Tn. <b> David K. West</b> was deceased by 1910. <b> Sue West</b> is found
in the 1910 Census of Madison County Al (adjacent to Limestone County) as a 65
year old widow living with her 40 year old single daughter <b> Willie
McClellan.</b> <br>
This cemetery located just inside (eastern) Limestone County AL is near the
western edge of Madison County. Sue may have lived across the line in Madison
County AL., but I believe the earlier Strong family were residents of
Meridianville in the north central part of Madison County, AL.<br>
Linda Smith mentions in the book &quot;Tombstone Inscriptions of Limestone
County Al&quot;,&nbsp; 4 Feb 1990, that there are six graves marked by
fieldstones with no inscription.&nbsp;</font>

Since this cemetery is within 2 miles of my home and I am a descendent of the
West family mentioned above who are indirectly connected to the McClellans'.&nbsp;
I have spent time clearing it of brush.&nbsp; I cleared enough so that it can
be seen from the Creekside Elementery Ball field. Maybe in the process of
playing ball the students will also get a history lesson. [WA 19 mar 2009.]<br>
