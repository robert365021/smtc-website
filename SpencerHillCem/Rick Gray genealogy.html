<DIV>No Wayne, I go to Beech Hill Cemetery. I am thinking about stopping where I am at on Arlington and finishing Beech Hill. I have it totally photographed - just have not done the transcription.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have been answering so much e-mail about Arlington lately. Alot of people are finding it and wondering why so and so's picture is not listed. Also some that I have not gotten too they believe are there. Some are older burials but are not listed in Hawkins book either. A lady contacted me yesterday about seeing a stone there in 1922 - the husband listed on one side and the wife on the other. Hawkins has the husband listed but not the wife. I have not photographed that area yet. Hopefuly after all this rain runs through I will be able to photograph the section and find out about this mystery.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I will check out Spencer Hill. I have a lot of family buried there including a set of great-grandparents. I am sure I will be able to add some things to it. I do not know much about the history of the cemetery other than it was established in 1850.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have photographed the Amis Cemetery that only has 3 graves in Culleoka. I will try to e-mail it to you soon. A few Saturdays ago they had an old slave cemetery open for one day here near Mt. Pleasant. I wanted to go so bad and was out of town. I meant to write you to see if you wanted to go. It was part of the home tour. The rest of the time the cemetery is closed off and not accessible. I thought it would been a nice addition to the cemetery site.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I do have photos from the recent Sandy Hook School reunion that I want to send to you for the School Site. INcluded in them are photos of a 91 year old teacher who taught at the (black) Sheepneck School near Sandy Hook. The reunion included that school too. Also in attendance that day was a 91 year old lady who did the cooking for the Sandy Hook School for many many years. It was great to hear both of the ladies speak and to talk with them afterwards. They were both so nice and the minds esp. the one of the former teacher was still very sharp. The reunion had at least 500 people in attendance. It is now planned as an annual event.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Talk to you later.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Rick</DIV>

<DIV></br></DIV>Rick I have finished uploading Spencer Hill Cemetery memorials. If you are interested in any of these people interred there or want to supply any genealogy you are welcome. I think there are a few old Church of Christ Preachers there. I would like to do a better job on the history. What I have posted there does not have enough originality to stand on its own merit very well.</br></br><A title=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~maury/cemetery/SpencerHillCem/SpencerHillCemetery.html href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~maury/cemetery/SpencerHillCem/SpencerHillCemetery.html">http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~maury/cemetery/SpencerHillCem/SpencerHillCemetery.html</A></br></br>I did get by the New Ramie Cemetery and photographed all the memorials there. The fellow who owns the land is Noel Moore my second cousin once removed. He is a retired banker but he knew my dad a lot better than I. I will publish the New Ramie Cemetery on the Internet as soon as I can get to the programming.</br></br>Mary Bob sent me photos on Bethel Cemetery. I don't think it is complete but I will probably use a complete list and her photos to do something there. Will focus on that next. Isn't that where you go to church?</br></br>Hope things are well with you</br></br>Wayne Austin</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Wayne Austin</br></br></br></br></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></BODY></HTML>
