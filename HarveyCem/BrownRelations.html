Walter Brown was Alma Alice Brown Harris's father, James David "Jim" Brown was 
her Mother's grandfather (Walter's father). His name on the rock is Jim. <br/>
Margaret Alice Harvey Brown was her Mother's grandmother (Walter's Mother). Dave 
Brown was Walter's brother, with his wife Minnie buried beside him. James Marion 
Brown was Walter's brother. Joe McKinley Brown was Walter's brother. Tivie Brown 
was Joe McKinley Brown's wife. Willie R Brown was Walter's brother and shares a 
rock with his wife Ellen L.<br/>
Charles Marion Harvey and Martha J. Hargrove were Mother's great grandparents 
being the parents of Margaret Alice Harvey Brown.<br/>
Charles Lee Harvey was the son of Charles Marion and Martha J and therefore 
Margaret Alice's brother. Charles Lee shares a rock with his wife Sarah 
Elizabeth. So you see Ruby has lots of kin there.<br/>
Ruby's Mother's Mother, Johnnie Mae Brown, was a widow for many years and per 
her desire she is buried in the nearby Ring Cemetery in Pottsville.<br/>
