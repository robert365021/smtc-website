<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Austin, I just have a little info
on cemeteries in Maury. I have done a lot of geneology and fieldwork on my
families and have a few additions for your website. <br/>
<br/>
PARK CEMETERY This cemetery is not found any any publication I know of. I
visited there and found  two unmarked but nicely cut fieldstones. [BT]<br clear="all"/>
<br/>
Location - On new Highway 50 near Interstate 65 about 800 yards east of Park
Station and about 50 yards south of Highway 50 on top of the hill. The land is
owned by Jerry Park, 2008. <br/>
In other words Park Station is 1 mile west of the exit 37 on highway 50 whereas
the cemetery is about 1/2 mile from I-65 exit 37. [BT]<br/>
<br/>
Joe Mack Hight told me these are the graves of Samuel Park and his wife. They
are the ancestors of all the Parks in that area.<br/>
