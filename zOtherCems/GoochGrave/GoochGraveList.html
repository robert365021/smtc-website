This area has been strip mined in the past leading researchers in the past to 
believe these stones were destroyed. We were delighted to hear that Andrew 
Tomlin with the help of historians at the Bethel Church of Christ were able to 
help him find this little cemetery and subsequently photograph these stones.</br>

<p>By 1835 the movement to restore New Testament 
Christianity was well established in Maury County, Tennessee. Numerous converts 
scattered throughout the county were attempting to organize churches founded 
only on the Bible without human creeds. No where was this effort any stronger 
than in the southern part of the county near Southport on the Giles County line. 
Here one of the untiring pioneer preachers lived.<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> 
William S. Gooch</span> was a farmer by occupation but dedicated much of his 
life to proclaiming Christianity. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Born in Granville County, North Carolina, he and his wife, Aley Jones, came 
to Maury County in 1825</span>. He lived south (SE) of Mt. Pleasant and was known to be a 
great debater. Along with L.A. Nichols who lived near Mt. Pleasant he preached 
some for the church on Cathy�s Creek. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> 
Gooch </span>established a congregation near his home. Thus the Bethel Christian 
Church had its beginning in 1835. Dying 
at the age of 51, his wife and five children buried him near the Bethel meeting 
house in a cemetery which is upon a hill south of the road. The year was 1851.<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></br>
</span></br>
The first meeting house of the Bethel church was built of logs with split log 
benches and lighted by oil lamps. It stood a few yards behind and west of the 
present house of worship. The history of the Bethel church of Christ is a 
history of the men and women who struggled to plant a congregation on the simple 
principles of the New Testament. One of the early stalwarts of the faith was 
Miles P. Murphy, Sr. The son of Nathaniel Murphy from Virginia, he married 
Eleanor Mack, from another early Maury County family. Like most of the first 
Bethel Church members, it can not be determined who was instrumental in his conversion. 
Joshua K. Speer and Wade Barrett were two early preachers who taught in 
Southport, but perhaps the tireless <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
William S. Gooch</span> deserves the credit for introducing Murphy to the 
Gospel. Miles Murphy, Sr. would loyally support the Bethel church until his 
death in 1874. Like many of his neighbors who had no strong ties to the cotton 
plantation system, Murphy would remain loyal to the Union during the Civil War. 
At his death, burial was made in the Murphy Cemetery not too far west from the 
Bethel church. He also served as an elder of the Bethel church prior to the 
Civil War along with Robert Franklin Matthews.</br>
</br>
In 1854 Robert F. and Sarah Eliza Bills Matthews moved to a small farm that 
included Miller Lake. Prior to the creation of this lake, the property was 
called the &quot;Canal Place&quot; because a visitor to the clear channel of water liken 
it to one of the canals in the North. Most of the Matthews� seven children were 
born at the Gidden's Place, four miles east of Mt. Pleasant. but the Panic of 
1837 forced this well-to-do investor to sell his plantation to his brother 
Elisha and move to Enterprise. After several more moves he was finally able to 
buy the �Canal Place� with the help of his wife�s inheritance. To supplement his 
income, Robert operated a freight business. One of the Matthews� nearest 
neighbors was the George W. Hubbell family, also Bethel members. Some of the 
members of this family if not all are buried in the Hubbell graveyard just up 
from the Miller Lake aka Badger Lake today. </br>
</br>
When the Matthews became Christians is unknown. Some evidence suggest that it 
may have been as early as the 1820�s or as late as the 1840�s. They were 
certainly influenced by Mrs. Matthews' parents, lsaac and Lillias Houston Bills. 
The Bills had been baptized at their plantation home 4 miles south of Columbia 
on the Mooresville Pike around 1814. Before moving to Maury County, this family 
had resided near Lexington, Kentucky, and often heard the preaching of Barton W. 
Stone. Robert F. Matthews� parents, however, were Presbyterians and were 
instrumental in organizing the Hopewell Presbyterian church near McCains.</br>
</br>
In addition to <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">William S. Gooch</span>, 
Matthews and Murphy did much of the preaching in those early years before 1860. 
A local tanner, William McConnell, also kept monthly preaching appointments here. 
Many families were converted and along with other Christians who moved into the 
community the size of the church quickly increased those first twenty years. It 
is believed the grave of William McConnell was in this area nearby, but perhaps 
the grave marker has succumbed to the hands of the strip miners.</br>

<u>William S. Gooch family history:</u></br>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">William S. Gooch</span>, born 1800 &amp; 
died 1851 married Alley Jones (called Alley, and in some places spelled Alsey).</br>
</br>
The Federal Census of 1850 of Maury County finds the following record:</br>
<u></br>
Surname Given Age </br>
</u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Gooch, William S.,&nbsp; </span>50 </br>
Gooch, Alsey&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45</br>

Gooch, Lucy A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</br>
Gooch, July Ann&nbsp; 15 </br>
</br>
The Federal Census of 1860 of Maury County finds the following record:</br>
<u></br>
Surname&nbsp; Given Age </u></br>
Gooch, Alsey&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55 </br>

Gooch, Alexander&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13</br>
</br>
In the 1850 Census there was seven children one was July Ann Gooch&nbsp; who does not appear to be an 
immediate member of the family. She was shown at the bottom of the list and her 
age does not line up. </br>
In the 1860 Census there was just Alsey and three children remaining. Since the 
tombstone records mention five children from the ages it appears at least two or 
more children were grown and had already established separate homes or perhaps 
they were deceased by 1860 and were buried in one of the graves marked only with field 
stones, mentioned above, thus there were five surviving children in 1851. </br>
We know from other records that there was already matured children living away 
from home. In the book Century Review of Maury County p. 288 we find this 
information on Roland Gooch, the third child. �Roland Gooch, b. Aug 14 1836, at 
Southport, Maury County, is the son of William S. &amp; Aley (Jones) Gooch who came 
from Granville County, North Carolina to Maury County in 1825. Roland married 
Nancy Jones daughter of Henry and Manerva (Corsort) Jones also from North 
Carolina�.</br>
