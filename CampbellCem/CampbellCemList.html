<p>The listing above was copied from the 
book &quot;They Passed This Way.&nbsp;&quot; The gate at the entrance to the property is 
padlocked. I have been advised permission can be obtained with the right 
contacts.</br>
</br>
Update: A researcher was able to get into the property 
with permission from Mr. Randle to photograph several overview photos in 1998. 
It is at this location. </br>

You will be going off site so hit your back button. Unfortunately you will not 
be able to confirm any inscriptions from the above site. The photographer did 
not focus on the individual stones. I only noticed one error on this site . The 
birth year of Collin Campbell is thought to be 1825 instead of 1927 as stated on 
this offsite. Out there the birth date is shown as occurring before the death 
date.</p>
<p><i>This cemetery listing was printed in various books of the past. Mr. Fred
Lee Hawkins in the book Maury County Tennessee
Cemeteries listed this cemetery about 1987 on page 134. Before that
it was listed in the book They Passed This way page B-76, about 1962.&nbsp;However
the original listing came from the book They Passed This Way. This info came from the above
book. Listing added here 22 Sep 2009.</i><B></br>
