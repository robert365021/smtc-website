  Hi Paulette Carpenter, Adm. of TNMAURY.</br>
  </br>
  I have a fascinating letter written by my great grandfather, and would love to
  pinpoint the location of the farm he mentions in this letter.&nbsp; The
  individual mentioned is Dr. Aaron White of Spring Hill.&nbsp; I will attach
  the</br>
  letter for your review.&nbsp; Any info about him would be great.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">I am now at the
        House of Dr. Aaron White, surrounded by all the Splendor of the South,
        but too sick to sit up but a few moments at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We left the Battlefield at Nashville on the 29th and came here on
        the Freight Cars - crowded up like sheep &amp; nearly froze by morning
        when we got out I could not stand - - our kind surgeon provided me with
        a room in the finest House in Town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><u>Every</u> <u>body </u>are rebels here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The boys eat Rebel Hay &amp; Rebel Mutton, Rebel Potatoes, Rebel
        Chickens &amp; etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>George
        Weeks found $200 dollars Confederate Money the other day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The owner came for it and he would not give it up - - The
        officers <u>don't</u> <u>know</u> any thing of these things as a matter
        of course. And consequently no one reports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>You would be surprised to see the destruction of property and
        wealth here men who 3 years ago were worth 3 &amp; $400.00 are now glad
        to eat parched corn or any thing else they get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The doctor where I am naping is a square out rebel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They have 4 children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
        is enough like Julia to be her twin sister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It makes me think of home but I am not there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>You seem to think that I <u>could </u><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>come
        home but the iron hand of Military rule ties Officers &amp; men equally
        alike and particularly when in an enemy's country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I can't come home till get leave depends all together on the
        Superior Commanders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Col.
        Blodgett would grant it any day but that is no use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I would be likely to be dismissed for cowardice if I was to ask
        for it here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We expect to
        fight here &amp; not get leave of absence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>You ask me if you shall sell Ben for $70.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Yes - I have ordered him sold - Tell Hal, whatever his pony
        brings I will invest for him when I come home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Home is sweet world when you are off from there away from every
        thing dear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Away not only
        in a land of Strangers, but deadly enemies and sick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Imagine how I feel &amp; whether I would not fly to you had I

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">You ask me if I have

        Coopers.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Historic thoughts on the life of Dr Aaron White, by Wayne
Austin. 8/12/07</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dr Aaron. White. 1822 � 1874 built and resided in the
home known as White Hall occupied in late times (1980s) by Mrs J. O. Morton of
Spring Hill according to historian &amp; author Jill Garrett.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dr White had practiced medicine in the Spring Hill and
Jackson College area in earlier times. I am enclosing a Civil War Story about Dr
White and his heroic efforts to save lives. He was known as the Doctor that took
sick people into his home or went to their home until they were better just as
he did with your George Hopkins. <o:p>

note: Announcement has been made of the addition of White Hall at Spring Hill to
the </span>National Register of Historic Places. The columned home, owned by

article in June 1973. Through the years we have had many requests for this </span>article,
being reprinted today.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style2"><span style="letter-spacing:.25pt" class="CharacterStyle1">Although
the 1973 writer did not give any details of the trouble between General Van Dorn
and Dr. Peters, in 1863 writers were not so reluctant. A<b> </b> </span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><b><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;letter-spacing:.25pt">New

9, 1863: &quot;It was </span><span style="letter-spacing:.05pt">reported by a
gentleman who has just come through military lines that Gen. Van Dorn was shot
and instantly killed </span><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">by Dr. Peters of
Maury County. Dr. Peters discovered Van Dorn in criminal intercourse with the
wife of </span>Dr. Peters.&quot;)<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style2" style="margin-top:.25in"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.25pt">Sometimes
late at night when the air is still, the sound of a horse galloping along the
Duplex Road in </span><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">Spring Hill shatters
the quietness. The hoof beats can be heard slowing up at the gate of White Hall;
and </span>in a few minutes there is silence, just as if the rider had reached
his destination and had hitched his horse.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style2"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">As
no one rides a horse at night in these times and the ghostly rider has never
been seen, some say it is </span>Dr. Aaron White, builder of White Hall, who is
returning from a late visit to a seriously ill patient. </span><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;letter-spacing:.3pt">Others
speculate that it could be a confederate courier coming to report to his
commanding officer </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">about the Yankees in
the Thompson Station area.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b></p>
<p class="Style3" style="margin-top:19.8pt"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">I<b>
</b>don't believe either story; however, both could be true as White Hall, the
home of Mrs. J. O. Morton </span>Sr., is one of the historic homes still
standing in Maury County.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Dr.
White, who practiced medicine in the Spring Hill area for many years, began
construction on his </span><span style="letter-spacing:.55pt">large,
square-pillared home in 1844 and the house was completed the following year.
White was </span>remembered as a very dedicated physician; he would literally
move into a home whenever he had a patient who was critically ill and needed his
care over a period of days.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">During
the Civil War he treated wounded soldiers, many of whom were housed here. In
later years one </span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">of his children
recalled being disturbed and frightened by the moans of the soldiers stretched
out in the </span>hall after the Battle of Franklin.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">White
was the attending physician to Gen. Richard S. Ewell during his last illness in
1872. The doctor </span>died in 1874 at the age of fifty-two and is buried in
the Spring Hill Cemetery.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.25pt">In
February 1863, Gen. Earl Van Dorn and his Confederate cavalry troops rode into
Maury County; and from the moment of his arrival, the dashing general was the
focus of flattering attention. Although </span><span style="letter-spacing:
.15pt">some doubted his military prowess, reports glowed of &quot;his
handsomeness, his chivalry, and his courage.&quot; He completely charmed the
ladies of Columbia, and an ungallant soldier wrote home that the headmaster </span>and
pupils at Columbia girls school fawned on the general.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.35pt">During
this time there were periodic raids and skirmishes, and Van Dorn kept his
headquarters in </span><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">Columbia until March
14 when a Union sympathizer set fire to a stable on South Main Street and burned
his staff's horses to death. He then moved to Spring Hill and established his
headquarters in the home of </span><span style="letter-spacing:
.35pt">Dr. White. Here he, his staff, and orderlies took over the entire house,
leaving only the dining room, </span>kitchen, and one bedroom for Dr. White, his
wife Margaret, and several small children.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">Again
in Spring Hill Van Dorn and his officers were lionized and the entertainments
were as splendid </span>as possible in the war torn village. He held several
military reviews which he attended resplendent in his <span style="letter-spacing:
.45pt">tailored uniform. These reviews were festive occasions and all the women
were invited. A trooper </span><span style="letter-spacing:.25pt">grumbled that
the cavalry wasted its time in reviews and dress parades &quot;for a few
lonesome and garish </span>young ladies.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3" style="margin-top:.05in"><span class="CharacterStyle1">Band
concerts were given by army bands. Spring Hill families entertained the soldiers
and &quot;the mansions were lighted until midnight.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">There
were some aspects about Van Dorn's social life which his hostess, Mrs. White,
did not care for, </span>and she informed her husband to get the general out of
her house.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">Now
one did not order a major general out of one's home and while Dr. White was
pondering the best </span>and most tactful way to get the general to leave, Van
Dorn sent for him. He told White that he was moving <span style="letter-spacing:
.35pt">his headquarters to the Martin Cheairs house (now Ferguson Hall of the
Tennessee Orphans Home), </span>much to the doctor's relief.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="Style3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Van
Dorn had been in his new headquarters less than a week when he was killed by Dr.
George B. </span>Peters; and White Hall only narrowly missed being the scene of
the county's most famous murder, a major sensation of the day and the matter for
hot dispute ever since.<o:p>

Hill showing the estate of Dr Aaron C. White during 1878. He died in 1874.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His home was located just of the east a few hundred yards of what was
then the &quot;Spring Hill Academy&quot;. The center of the business district
which is pretty much the same today. The Cemetery was on a street to the south
behind his home. That is McLemore St today. I highlighted his parcal of land and
you can see where the house stands still today.</p>

Dr White had a daughter named Julia who died in 1859 just prior to the civil War

Spring Hill Aerial Map today compliments of Map Quest. I
tried to place the arrows for the cemetery and home in the right place but the
home might be about 1 inch to the left of where I pointed the arrow as you can
see a large place there also. The cemetery is almost straight south of the Home
on the 1878 map and that appears to be so here also if the home 1 inch to the
left was Dr Whites Home.</p>
