Location from Pulaski: Take highway 31 south toward Elkton, but in Tarpley turn east on 
the Tarpley Shop Road and go just over 3 miles and turn right (south) into the 
drive of the brick home. The cemetery can be seen in the yard on the far side 
(east) from the driveway of the home.<br>

This aerial view shows the cemetery marked with a red check on the east side of 
the home but the cemetery is actually mostly under the trees next to the home.<br>
<img border="0" src="GrubbsCemAerial.jpg" width="1352" height="660"><br>
This view shows the house better and the cemetery next to the home on the east 
side. The stones are not visible here. The cemetery is about 50 yards from the 
home. It is being mowed as part of the yard as you will see from the photos.<br>
