This map shows the GPS location of our best estimate as to where this cemetery 
(or at least the stones) was located before Bobby Prosser removed them to the 
Prosser Cemetery in Marshall County and leaned them against a tree there. <br>

This Prosser Cemetery in 
Bartlett Hollow has basically been destroyed. It is located on Bartlett Hollow road on the 
Billy Powell Farm. My (Bobby Prosser) father and I found this cemetery back in 
the 1980's. The Cemetery was in a barn lot with cattle and other farm animals 
wondering about.&nbsp; The above location is Bobby Prosser and other's best 
guess where this cemetery was located. There is some question if this was the 
location or the gravestones were removed from the graves before Bobby moved them 
to Marshall Co to the Prosser Cemetery.<br>

The home across the road belongs to the Powell family.<br>

Evidently the cattle are gone from the pasture in this roadside photo showing 
the weeds and vegetation everywhere. Photo taken by Bobby Prosser, based on his 
memory of where the place where he picked up the stones from the barnyard. Bobby 
says the place was just over this fence.
