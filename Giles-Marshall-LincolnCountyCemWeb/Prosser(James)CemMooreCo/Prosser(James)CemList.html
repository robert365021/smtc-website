This Prosser Cemetery we list here in 
Bartlett Hollow has been destroyed. It is located on Bartlett Hollow Road on the 
Billy Powell Farm. My (Bobby Prosser) (father and I found this cemetery back in 
the 1980's. The Cemetery was in a barn lot with cattle and other farm animals 
wondering about. It had been destroyed. We picked up James Prosser and Frances 
Richardson Prosser's tombstones. I brought the stones home with me and kept them 
in my shed for a time. They were lying in barnyard &quot;Gook.&quot; and would have been 
lost&nbsp; I did not want to lose any more of the family history. In recent years I 
have carried the stones to another well cared for Prosser Cemetery in Marshall 
County where their son Jonathan, my great grandfather, is buried. B.P.</p>
<p>So we have the tombstones in the Prosser Cemetery in Marshall County. 
The burials are actually still located in the destroyed Cemetery in Bartlett 
Hollow near what was an old barn. Barn is now abolished.</p>
