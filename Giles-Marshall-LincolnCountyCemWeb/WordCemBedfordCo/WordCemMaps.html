To find Word Cemetery go south on Hwy 231 out of Shelbyville 4.7 miles from 
the Parkway bypass to New Center Church Road and turn left. Go 2.5 five miles 
and turn south (right)&nbsp; onto Amos Gamble Road and follow that for 1/2 mile 
and look west (right) into an open field. The cemetery is down the edge of the (western 
bound) hedge row on the north side of that field. When the hedge row ends turn 
left and follow the hedge row in a southerly direction. The cemetery as you see in 
the below maps juts out into the field and it being under the trees.<br>
