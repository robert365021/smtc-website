					J.B. Winn would be the best one to carry on with keeping 
					this cemetery active on the internet. I think J.B. younger 
					than the rest of us. I try to keep in touch with his mother 
					Sharon. I live in Iowa and they live in Missouri. I wish we 
					had some one closer to continue on. Margaret Billington is 
					in her 70's and still takes care of the Billington cemetery 
					across the road from her home which is less than 5 mi. from 
					this farm inside Maury County and north of Hwy 99:<br>

					Ezekiel's tombstone is not up next to Hwy 99. It is in the 
					middle of a pasture where Frank Osteen has cows on 
					this(his)land. I received permission from him and met his 
					daughter Rebecca who let me into the property to get back to 
					the grave. The gate to the house is locked and has a 
					security system on it. Frank is the one who is trying to 
					clean up the area on his land. <br>
					fosteen@bellsouth.net this is his email if you need to gain 
					access. He is the one to contact about further maintenance 
					of this grave site as the cemetery is on his private 
					property. <br>
					I am attaching some photos, I took the first 2 and Frank 
					sent me the other 2 showing how it looked last fall.<br>
					<br>
					As far as putting some of this information on the 
					Find-a-Grave site I don't have a problem with that but I 
					credit J.B. Winn's leadership for his efforts to clean up 
					this area. I know his father Lonnie was having health issues 
					earlier in April so I don't know where they stand on upkeep.<br>
					<br>
					Thank you for your efforts and the posting to findagrave and 
					this site.<br>

					I am unrelated to the Billingtons, but keep my ears attuned 
					to historic information like this to add to findagrave.com 
					and/or my cemetery site. If you would like that record to 
					maintain it on findagrave let me know and I will transfer it 
					to you. Especially if you are younger than I. &quot;Maintain it&quot; 
					on findagrave.com means nothing except simply make any 
					updates or changes in the future if additional information 
					becomes available no so unlike you do on Ancestry.com.<br>
					<br>
					I think it was J.B. Winn who gave me permission and help to 
					post all that, but unfortunately since I did not visit the 
					site I am guessing at the mapping. However it is a very 
					experienced guess using the latest techniques and maps on 
					the internet coupled with that J.B. said and the book 
					Marshall County Tennessee Cemeteries. It is important to say 
					this cemetery has not been mapped so is left off of all 
					national mapping efforts to locate all the cemeteries.<br>
					<br>
					I will still maintain the cemetery since all that Latitude &amp; 
					Longitude stuff blows some folks away. <br>
					<br>
					I would like to do better job of locating the stone. I 
					initially had the cemetery located in a ditch beside the 
					road in front of an old abandoned house? The job of posting 
					the Lat/Log is some easier since the stone was located in 
					the Billington Cemetery of Marshall County which is in the 
					county cemetery book.<br>

					Hi! I found you through Find a Grave and information you 
					posted about Ezekiel Billington 1759 - 1848. He is buried 
					near Lewisburg, TN. <br>
					Ezekiel Billington was my 5th Great Grandfather. I searched 
					for his grave and was assisted by Margaret Billington who 
					lives near this farm where he is buried. James Brent Winn 
					and his father Lonnie Winn came from Missouri in Jan. 2003 
					and cleared this area and put a fence around it. J. Brent 
					had been in the Marines and contacted the Veterans 
					Administration to report that there was a Revolutionary War 
					Veteran buried in this cemetery. The VA provided the stone 
					and they placed it in this cemetery in 2003. <br>
					<br>
					I am Marcia Billington Williams and I found Margaret and 
					have kept in touch with her. Working with her we located the 
					current owner of this farm. We got permission to come on to 
					the land and I took a couple of pictures and posted them on 
					Ancestry.com with my Family Tree &quot;James Billington 1723. 
					This was Ezekiel's father.<br>
					<br>
					I thought I would pass along this information. The farm is 
					now owned by Frank Osteen who lives in Georgia. I have been 
					in touch with him and he is trying to clean this area up and 
					maintain it in between his busy working schedule. His email 
					address is: fosteen@bellsouth.net.<br>
					This is the email address for Lonnie and Sharon Billington 
					Winn who placed the stone: landswinn@sbcglobal.net<br>
					<br>
					Sincerely<br>
					Marcia Billington Williams<br>
