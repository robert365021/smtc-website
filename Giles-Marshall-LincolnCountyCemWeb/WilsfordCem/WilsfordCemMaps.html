This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Wilsford Cemetery.
The nearest major town is Old Lynnville formally Waco, Tennessee about 5+ miles as a crow flies 
northeast.&nbsp;<br>

Location Go Hwy 31 north from Pulaski to Kerr Hill Road and turn left. Follow 
that for about 2 miles and two tenths and look to the left 100 yards into a 
field for a grove of trees that contains the cemetery. There is a gate into the 
pasture that is usable to visit this cemetery. Be sure to close it behind you 
because there are cattle in this field. Otherwise I think the right of way to 
this cemetery is clear.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery out in a field just before the road bends 
back toward the south marked by a red check. The outline of the white picket 
fence can be seen on this map.<br>
