  This topographical map shows the cemetery with a big red check. It is not
  listed on any map that I know of but is very large and should be so listed due
  to its prominence. <span id="center-point0">The GPS is 35.3209� N X 86.8735� W
	</span>Another way of calculating this is finds the Latitude 35 degrees 19.254' and
  86 degrees 52.41' Longitude. It is elevation 820 feet. Approximate size is
  200' X 200' Feet squared on an east/west line. <br>

  Directions to this cemetery are: Take I-65 south from Nashville and go 60+
  miles to Exit 22 shown above on this map. Exit left onto Highway 31 Alt and go 6
  tenths of a mile and after crossing Richland Creek turn left into a long
  private drive. After the turn the cemetery can be seen at the crest of the
  hill on your right out northwest of you about 200 yards in a clump of trees. <br>
  However, first go to the end of the driveway (shown above as a dotted line
  road) and access permission from this fussy owner. You will be called to the
  carpet for not doing so. Also stay off his crops/grass and fences and refrain
  from making his livestock nervous (loud noise) and I think you will be
  welcomed and provided a route to drive there in dry weather. Now as much as 
	the owner has has abused this cemetery it is hard for me to be civil but 
	civil is the only way to be.<br>

  This aerial view shows what you will encounter in finding this cemetery. The 
	yellow (or as my 4 year old grand son would say &quot;lello plus&quot;) plus marks the spot 
	beween I-65 &amp; Hwy 31 Alt. The dotted lines is the Marshall/Giles County 
	line.<br>

	<font color="#000080" size="2"><b>This aerial closer in view shows the clump 
	of trees in the cemetery. The private road can be seen here running along 
	the bottom of the map.<br>
	What you are looking at as a tiny spot on the north side of the cemetery is 
	some kind of hanging barrel full of something the cattle rancher-owner uses 
	to dispense something to his cattle. That is no way to treat a historic 
	cemetery, but he does not care because it seems none of us care either or 
	we'd stop it. This becomes instead of a cemetery just an oasis for the 
	cattle. It is my understanding that in the past the attitude of the 
	landowner may have determined whether a cemetery became listed on public 
	maps. Since this one is not then we see the abuse here perhaps spans many 
	generations. Surely sometimes in the past there was a deed giving this 
	cemetery land to make this a public cemetery but I have not investigated 
	that.<br>
