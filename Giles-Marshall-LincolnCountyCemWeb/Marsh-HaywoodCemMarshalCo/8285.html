  Could I get someone to do a Lookup in Marshall Co. for me? I want to know
  where my g-grandmother is buried. She was last in Marshall Co. early months Jan. or Feb. of 1878 when she died. Her name was SARAH
  JANE HOLLOWAY FINE CLICK. Her husbands name was JAMES GRAY CLICK. He
  married very soon after she died to a Ms Noblett in Marshall Co. He had two children by Sarah Jane and
  I believe they were raised by James and Ms. Noblett. Any help is greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Sincerely, <BR>Mildred
  C. Cast.</font></p>

  From the Marshall County Cemetery Book the only CLICK that is shown as buried in the county is J. G. CLICK, Died 1884, age about 65 years.
  J. G. may be the initials of your JAMES GRAY CLICK. He is buried in the HAYWOOD-MARSH CEMETERY, located two miles south of
  Cornersville, on the Pulaski Highway.<BR><BR>Bobby Prosser<BR>&lt;prossergenealogy@comcast.net&gt;<br>

  Hi Wayne,<br>
  James Gray Click was married the first time to a Sarah Bailey and had 9 or 10
  children by her in Cocke Co. Tn.. Sarah then died and he married my
  great-grandmother, Sarah Jane Holloway FINE, whose previous husband was Wesley
  Fine from Cocke Co. Wesley died in the civil war at Vicksburg, Ms. in 1864.<br>
  Sarah Jane and Wesley Fine had 2 children, Mary Elizabeth and Sythe Ellen
  Fine, my grandmother. Sarah Jane married James Gray Click and they had John C.
  Click and Marinda J. Click. John was born in 1868 and I don't have proof now,
  but I believe Marinda was born first in 1866. A distant relative sent me a
  copy of a page out of a family bible showing where relatives in Tn. had kept
  notes as to dates of my grandmothers sister and her births, along with a note
  of the birth of M. Click born July the 27, 1866. It doesn't say married, to a
  M. Click. So, I think that she had already married James Gray Click before
  1866 . Sarah Jane died in 1878 in Marshall Co. James Gray Click didn't stay a
  widow very long as he then married a Ms. Elizabeth Noblett about 2 mos. later,
  March 14, 1878 in Giles Co. I hope that I haven't confused anyone. Sincerely,<br>
