  <font color="#CC3300" size="2">BARLAR, William Henry, born about 1823 &amp; died cir Mar 23, 1897. (Husband of
  Susan Frances Phillips and father of 10 children)<br>
  </font>
  <font color="#000080" size="2">Recent finds in the records of Giles County reveals there was a Newspaper and
  book record of a William Barl<u>o</u>r who died about Mar 23, 1897 in the
  Brick Church Community with a condition the newspaper called La Grippe.
  Accordingly he was about 75 years of age and was buried in the Hayw<u>ar</u>d
  Cemetery. Since this Marsh-Haywood Cemetery is very near his last known
  residence over west of I-65 (can be seen from this cemetery) I
  believe this to be the cemetery and the name Hayw<u>ar</u>d Cemetery was a corruption of the name Hayw<u>oo</u>d. A study of the earlier name used
  for this cemetery may be helpful to determine if the name Marsh was tacked on
  later, but certainly Marsh is the most prevalent surname here.&nbsp;<br>
  It is not known if a stone can be found here. The old time Barlar's who died
  out between 1960-1990 say William was
  interred in an old cemetery under a memorial stone which is now supposedly
  near Interstate 65 &amp; Highway 31 Alt. In the 1940s a farmer purchased
  the property and razed the cemetery and carted the stones off to the backside
  of the property and buried them in a ditch to create more tillable land area. This
  may be true if Barlar is interred in another small nearby cemetery, but it is
  my conclusion he is here. In this cemetery there is no clear evidence of gross
  criminal behavior. We see the usual abuse related to neglect and cattle. There was some abusive piling up of the common stones that mark graves
  (picture above) and damage from livestock carousing the cemetery and relieving
  their itch by rubbing on the stones causing the stones to dislocate and fall.
  Beyond that the trees and growth caused most of the damage when their roots
  push up and caused the stones to become dislocated and fall. Large trees
  fall and crush the stones as can readily be seen in this cemetery from the
  photos. Since the unlawful act mentioned above is unproven I will not mention
  names here, but there was a name given and it is known in wide circles of the
  Barlar family and the historical society of Giles County, but affects no
  living person today that I know of.<br>
  In the interest of showing both sides Ms. Ward who has something to do with
  this property today said she heard at one time there was a lost cemetery on
  the other side of Richland Creek also on the north side of Hwy 31 Alt. She
  further said in earlier times a farmer by the name of Scrapper Jones did
  destroy it. Further she said today they are a bit superstitious about that
  land as it seems to spawn bad things such as diseases &amp; lost crops etc. so
  they do not use it anymore. When I tried to pinpoint the place from here she
  grew defensive and I did not get an answer. Obviously converting such hearsay into
  fact 65 years or so later is difficult.<br>
