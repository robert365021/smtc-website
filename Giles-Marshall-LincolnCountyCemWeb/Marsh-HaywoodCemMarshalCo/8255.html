  Mary F. Ferguson. Boxtomb. 17 Jul 2008 photo. We can't seem to get this
  inscription. In 2005 (photo below) there was a large tree lying across the
  tomb. Today most of the tree has decayed,&nbsp; but the tomb is broken and the
  top part with the inscription is lying upside down on our left. It weighs
  about 500 lbs and I am not going to lift it back on without equipment. This
  tomb was not broken in 2005, that is a fresh break. [WA 7/23/2008]<br>

  FERGESON, Mary F., Oct 23, 1798 - Jul 30, 1859. It is obvious how buried into
  the fallen Cherry tree this memorial is. I don't know if today it is free of
  the limbs but will be shortly thru decay. However the rotting limbs are
  usually replaced by a vigorous growth of brush which becomes equally hard to
  eradicate. This is a vicious cycle.<br>
