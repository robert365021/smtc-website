<p><b><font color="#000080">At first I was 
looking for the Hugh Campbell Cemetery on the north side Elkton-Prospect road. 
My first guess was to ask a fellow in his driveway. He did not know, but 
referred me across the road to a house and there the fellow told me to see Fred 
Elder up Liberty Hill Road. He knows cemeteries. Fred lived in one of those old 
antebellum houses on the left up Liberty Hill Road about a mile. Sure enough Mr. 
Elder was home and he knew Robert Liles and where the Hugh Campbell Cemetery was 
located who owned the cemetery. Fred was having difficulty explaining where the 
house/cemetery was located so he agreed to accompany me to the cemetery. We 
backtracked to Elkton-Prospect road, went west then south down Poplar School 
Road and turned right on Poplar Hill Road. Afer about a 1/2 mile we tuned left 
into a long driveway and went to an old antebellum home founded by the 
Campbell's in about 1820. Out from their yard was the cemetery. Mr. Liles came 
to the door. Both him and Fred were related to the folks in that cemetery. Soon 
Mr. Liles's wife joined us and as I surveyed the cemetery I was accompanied by a 
reunion of folks and friends of the community. Mrs. Liles was a direct 
descendent of the cemetery and they said if you want to know what those folks 
looked like just glance at her.&nbsp; Thankfully its more complex than that.<br>
