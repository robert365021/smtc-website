This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Houze Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="HouzeCemRd.jpg" width="1600" height="804"><br>
This road map shows the cemetery on the left after you bear right onto Indian 
Creek Road. If you choose not to use the gated entrance you will quickly go down a hill 
and to get to the cemetery from there you will find it a steep climb up a bank covered in vines with a fence at the top. 
You will need permission to get past the locked gate on your left after 
passing the water tower and merging onto Indian Creek Road. Alternative 
directions: Go Highway 64E; turn right into Pisgah Road. Bear to right on Indian 
Creek Road and go past the water tower. Gate to left. From there look east and 
just to the left of the power lines at the tree line. The cemetery is next to 
the tree line in a cattle field.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery on the left of a fenced enclosure (surrounded 
by trees). I have no idea why the fenced enclosure (shown above in this aerial 
image) exist unless it is for cattle herding.<i> </i>This cemetery has been 
trampled down by cattle and ignored for years. Put a fence around it and the 
brush takes over. Leave it as is and the cattle will trample it to pieces - your choice. 
Folk don't realize that all one needs to do to destroy an old cemetery is ignore 
it.<i><br>

</i>The black arrow shown in the photo points out one of the cemetery stones. It 
is in the distance 
showing up here as a pale white object at the edge of the trees. We are standing 
just inside the gate.<i><br>
