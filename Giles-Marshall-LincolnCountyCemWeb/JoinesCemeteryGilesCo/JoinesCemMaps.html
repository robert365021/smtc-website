This aerial view shows the cemetery on the left of Petty Hollow Road far back
northwest off the road. The </font>cemetery is on left of Petty Hollow
Road over the hill about 3 tenths of a mile northeast from Cook Cemetery. No
road leading there. <font size="3">The yellow arrow points out the spot. </font>Stop at
Cook Cemetery and walk the rest of the way.&nbsp; Follow the highlighted yellow path
on the above map and go north from Cook
Cemetery until the fence line comes up. Follow along the fence line going west on the south
side of the fence climbing over the hill. The gate into the north field is on the other
side of the hill into the next field. After&nbsp;exiting the gate (Possibly
locked) continue west on
the fence row down the hill on the other side.&nbsp; Next bear right or northward away
from your fence line out into the field toward the edge of a south facing tree line
across that field. Cemetery is in the edge of the field just inside of the
trees. This is about 3 tenths of a mile northwest from Cook Cemetery. You will
need permission from the owner for all of this as the gate may be locked and
cattle was in the area when I was there.&nbsp;Please travel quietly and give the
cattle ample space so they are not disturbed.<font size="3">
