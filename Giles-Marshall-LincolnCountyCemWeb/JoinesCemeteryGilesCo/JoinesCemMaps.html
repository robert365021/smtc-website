This map shows the Joines Cemetery northeast of Cook Cemetery over the hill off
of Cook Hollow Road. With this map we also see the GPS
Coordinates - Latitude and Longitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><br>

</b>Location: Highway 64 West, right into Campbellsville Road. Right into
Minnow Branch Road; bear left at forks to Cook Hollow Road. Stop at Cook
Cemetery and walk the rest of the way; cemetery on left of road over the hill
about 3 tenths of a mile northeast from Cook Cemetery. No road leading to it. Go
north from Cook Cemetery until the fence line comes up. The gate is on the other
side of the hill into the next field. After&nbsp; exiting the gate go west down
the fence row down the hill on the other side.&nbsp; bear right toward edge of
other tree line across that field. Cemetery is in the edge of the field just
inside of the trees. This is about 4 tenths of a mile from Cook Hollow Road

This aerial view shows the cemetery on the left of Petty Hollow Road far back
northwest off the road. The cemetery is on left of Petty Hollow
Road over the hill about 3 tenths of a mile northeast from Cook Cemetery. No
road leading there. The yellow arrow points out the spot. Stop at
Cook Cemetery and walk the rest of the way.&nbsp; Follow the highlighted yellow path
on the above map and go north from Cook
Cemetery until the fence line comes up. Follow along the fence line going west on the south
side of the fence climbing over the hill. The gate into the north field is on the other
side of the hill into the next field. After&nbsp;exiting the gate (Possibly
locked) continue west on
the fence row down the hill on the other side.&nbsp; Next bear right or northward away
from your fence line out into the field toward the edge of a south facing tree line
across that field. Cemetery is in the edge of the field just inside of the
trees. This is about 3 tenths of a mile northwest from Cook Cemetery. You will
need permission from the owner for all of this as the gate may be locked and
cattle was in the area when I was there.&nbsp;Please travel quietly and give the
cattle ample space so they are not disturbed.
