  From the above map we are given my best estimate of where the Strong Cemetery 
is located based on what I read in the book Giles County Tennessee Cemeteries. . 
This is known as the GPS location.<br>
<img border="0" src="StrongCemRd-maybe.jpg" width="1920" height="869"><br>
Location: Take Highway 31/7 south from Pulaski. Turn right on Prospect Road at Tarpley Shop. 
Go about 5 miles and past Aspen Hill. The Strong cemetery is about 1 mile past Aspen Hill on right.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows my best guess as to where this cemetery is located. My 
conclusion which could be wrong was made after studying the terrain and given 
that it is probably an abandoned cemetery and resides in a tree lined thicket. 
If you know where this cemetery is located please e-mail Wayne -
