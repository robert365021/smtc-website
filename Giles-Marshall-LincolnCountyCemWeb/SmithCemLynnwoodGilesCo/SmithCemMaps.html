Lynnwood Cemetery.) - GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

Smith Cemetery GPS at N 35.37477 X W -87.01402. See Mr. Nathan Smith's letter 
below.<br>

While traveling East Turn south (right) off of Hwy 129 across from Lynnwood 
Cemetery, but 300 feet east of Lynnwood Cemetery and drive up the field road to 
the old fallen house thicket using the field road into the place. After you come 
to the tree line turn right up the slope and drive west along the brush line 
almost to the end at top of the hill.<br>
Turn into the brush going south and look for an overgrown chain link fence. 
There you will see a fence and the gate is there. Careful it is slippery and 
steep going down to the level of the cemetery. <br>
My grandmother talked to me (Nathan Smith b. abt 1924)about this 75 years ago. I have walked there many 
times before when it was not overgrown. My son and I used to hunt there in the 
50's and 60's when living in Memphis. Grandma Nathan Smith told me the house 
slaves were buried about where the two corner chain link posts are located 
closest to the house. That would be the NE and SE corners.<br>
Mr Arnold Williams is the owner of the place. He lives down Hwy 31 (west side) a mile.<br>

Nathan I am Wayne Austin the party looking for the Smith Cemetery across from 
Lynnwood Cemetery in Lynnville Tennessee. I see you have been talking to Mary 
Bob about clearing the brush from the Smith Cemetery.<br>
&nbsp;So you are confirming the cemetery is in the upper (western) part of that 
thicket on the upper side. It is a big thicket in center of the field where the 
old house stood. The brush and briars in that area are very thick. Mr Arnold 
Williams the land owner 
knows where it is except he has no interest. I am happy to go there and clear some brush sometime but 
that is a winter time task.<br>
I know the Owners, the Williams because they have two or three cemeteries on 
their property I have visited. The Evans Cemetery and the two Tacker Cemeteries. 
I had to contact them to get into the Tacker Cemetery, but the Evans Cem has a 
clear right of way.<br>
I don't think their patients from Cemetery visitors 
is very high, but don't see you having problems?<br>
