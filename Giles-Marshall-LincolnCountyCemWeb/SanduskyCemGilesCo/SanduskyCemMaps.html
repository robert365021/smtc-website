Go west on Hwy 64 out of Pulaski Tennessee and turn north on the old Hwy 64 
which leads to Weakley Creek Road. It may be labeled Weakley Creek Road instead 
of Old Hwy 64. Pass Weakley Creek Road and another half mile and with advanced 
permission enter the private drive of the good folks that live there. Drive up 
to where the driveway splits into the circular Drive and the little cemetery is 
out in the field to your left about 400 yards. There is a photo from that 
driveway on this site for your viewing of the cemetery in the distance. Today 
the cemetery is marked by a Hackberry Tree which hovers over the graves.</b></span><b> 
The cemetery was recently fenced by barb-wire with no gate.&nbsp;</b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

This Aerial view marks some of the geographic features you will see 
that will aid in your attempt to find this cemetery. The Highway shown here 
is now the old Hwy 64. Coming from Pulaski it may be marked as the access  
to Weakly Creek Road but also has entrance to the Choates Creek Road. This road 
veers off of the New Highway 64 just past Bodenham and merges back into it after 
several miles.<br>
