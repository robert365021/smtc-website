Hughes Cemetery on the edge of Lawrence County line, 
a couple of miles from here:<br>
Note: J.W &amp; Delia Sandusky's original monuments were moved to the Hughes 
Cemetery on the edge of the Lawrence County Line years ago and lie there in the 
Moore Lot enclosure. I doubt if the grave remains were moved. Stones there are 
as follows:<br>
James W. Sandusky&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; 
buried in Sandusky 
Cemetery, Giles County, just N. of Old Hwy 64 where a
small granite monument was recently set. 
The original stone was moved to Hughes Cemetery years ago&nbsp;

Other graves
- once a larger cemetery. Tilling or keeping livestock on 
the land over time 
reduces the size of the area of these old cemeteries especially when the graves 
are not marked by formal markers that survive in a standing state. Many stones 
fall and sink below the surface and are lost. Others wash down the hillside and 
into ditches and creeks and are covered, and off course there is often human 
destruction involved. <br>
<br>
This Sandusky family was closely connected to the Sandusky's at the nearby
<a href="../ChoateCreekMethodistChCem/ChoateCreekCemList.htm">Choates Creek U. 
Methodist Church Cemetery</a>. Folks there are all younger, including one son.</p>
<p>
Long time residents in this community say the McKnight cemetery was nearer the road 
on the same farm. Many graves were there (1989-G.C.T.C.). No easily visible sign of 
another cemetery today (2011-C.W. Austin).<br>
<br>
Only two original stones appear to remain standing today in the Sandusky 
Cemetery. Both are old lime/sandstone footstones 
and appear to be for Delia Sandusky. One is Delia Sandusky's footstone with the 
initials D.S. The second stone is a broken stone that is likely the 
original headstone for Delia because it aligns with her footstone. It is broken off and 
today is totally encapsulated by the hackberry tree with the top half of the 
stone missing. Of course the original stones may have been moved from their 
original locations muddying the water of this analysis. <br>
<br>
The three new stones, one for each listing, recently installed and shown above 
are small granite markers put there by descendents who wish to maintain the 
original location of the Sandusky graves. It is not known if there are other 
family members without a headstone buried here. Does not appear to me the new 
markers align with the footstones of Delia Sandusky as that grave lies between 
the tree and her footstone and just beside that is the new marker for James W. 
Sandusky. Well, so much for trying to analyze the grave locations when that is 
basically lost today, but at least some graves lie outside the fence and under 
the fence line.</p>
