					Obituary: The Pulaski Citizen 3 Aug 1899<br>
					<br>
					Born Nov. 20, 1871, married to Dr. W. H. Watson Jan. 2, 
					1895, died July 27, 1899. Her grandmother was so perfectly 
					devoted to her it does seem that she was the proper one to 
					go to her so soon, but that broken-hearted mother, father, 
					sister, and husband�Can they ever be reconciled? Why she was 
					taken is a mystery. We dare not doubt God�s divine will and 
					appointments, but we could specially pray that grace be 
					given them to say, �Thy will, not mine, be done.� Her 
					husband�s home is broken up and the empty halls of her 
					father�s, without grandmother and Julia are desolate indeed. 
					The merry ring of laughter is hushed�no happy girl to come 
					in and cheer father and mother, for she only saw the bright 
					side of life. Just before she was taken sick, with tears in 
					her eyes, she went to the altar and gave the minister her 
					hand, purporting to lead a new life, and the tear of a 
					repentant sinner never did fall to unbar the beautiful gates 
					of the heavenly city, and while we grieve and miss her, we 
					feel it is better further on, and ask her loved ones to put 
					their trust in Him who will never forsake them. �And with 
					the morn those Angel faces smile, Which we have loved, long 
					since and lost awhile.� A Friend. Mrs. Watson leaves a 
					husband, father, mother, and sister, and a host of friends 
					to mourn her loss. She was laid to rest in the cemetery at 
					Mt. Zion.<br>
