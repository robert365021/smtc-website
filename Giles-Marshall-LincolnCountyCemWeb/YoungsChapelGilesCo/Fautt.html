					Obituary: The Pulaski Citizen 21 Oct 1931 Fayetteville &quot;Dr. 
					Love&quot;<br>
					Mrs. Alice Story Fautt died at Frankewing Sept. 29, 1931 
					minus a few days, native of South Bradshaw only daughter of 
					Mr. and Mrs. M. S. Story of blessed memory. She was buried 
					at Young's Chapel where her parents, also three brothers 
					were buried, Hugh, John, and Elmo Story. Surviving her are 
					one son, Robert Fautt of Pulaski and one daughter, Mrs. H. 
					L. Patterson of Frankewing; five grandchildren, also three 
					brothers, R. F., and T. A. of Frankewing and Ross Story of 
					Nashville. She was above the average for intelligence and a 
					fine conversationalist. Services were held at the Chapel 
					where Dr. Brown spoke the last words of eulogy for the dead 
					also words of sympathy for the living. Her consort died when 
					their children were babies and she had the responsibilityof 
					teaching them right from wrong and succeeded. David said 
					man's allotted time is three score years and ten. If by 
					reason of strength he live four score yet shall his strength 
					be labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away. 
					This declaration then proves to my mind that God will not 
					take any man or woman before their allotted time expires. 
					Nor does he cause any man or woman to die a premature death. 
					Man possesses a living vital organism and God intended for 
					him to live until he wore out like any other machine that 
					man has invented. Therefore we are not going to charge God 
					with taking any man or woman when they die a natural death. 
					I was away from home when this good woman died, therefore, I 
					couldn't write it sooner.<br>

					Fautt at Young's Chapel, which occurred Feb. 23 at his home 
					near Bryson. The entire communityhas experienced a sore 
					affliction in his death. The friend with whom we took sweet 
					counsel is gone. He leaves his wife and little ones in great 
					sorrow. We extend our sympathy to the bereaved ones and we 
					can say, weep not, for he is at rest.<br>
