					On September 24, 1944, at 4:00 p.m., the Young's Chapel 
					Presbyterian Communities lost one of its eldest and best 
					loved members in the death of Mrs. Ellla Hollis Birdsong. 
					She was born in 1863. Early in life she became a Christian 
					and lived all her life in this community. From early in life 
					she continued to grow in grace, knowledge, love for God. She 
					was married to Ben Birdsong, who preceded her in death about 
					2 years ago. Together they embellished a Christian home into 
					which were born ten children, the lives of whom testified to 
					the sterling qualities of her character. She leaves eight 
					children, three sons and five daughters, also seventeen 
					great-grandchildren and a host of relatives and friends to 
					mourn their loss. She won a place in the hearts of all who 
					knew her, by her constant Christian life and interest in the 
					welfare of all in the community. As a wife and mother, she 
					was faithful in teaching her familybyprecept and example the 
					wayof a noble life. She was always optimistic and possessed 
					a sweet, kind and lovable disposition, and a spirit to get 
					along with people. So not only her family but all who knew 
					her will call her blessed. She was a faithful Christian and 
					a constant attendant upon the worship services of Young's

					1837. He came from a fine old family in Southern Tennessee,

					surgeon. He was captured at Fort Donelson in February 1862, 
					and exchanged in September 1862. Later he was surgeon of 
					Brown's Brigade and of Brown's Division. He was paroled at 
					Greensboro, N. C. May 1, 1865, and as stated above attained 
					the rank of major. About fifteen years ago he removed to 
					Nashville and successfully practiced medicine. In addition 
					to being a very fine surgeon, he was a physician of note. 
					Dr. Grand had an office in East Nashville for a number of 
					years, and later located in the central part of the city. No 
					children resulted from his marriage. Dr. Grant was an 
					interesting raconteur, and in additions to the war stories

					Mrs. Fannie Watson is no more. A short time ago we wrote up 
					the Watsons reunion and also a sketch of this subject and we 
					heard that she was well pleased with what we said and now it 
					will not be necessary to repeat some things said on that 
					occasion. On Wednesday night, Dec. 19, 1917, death came to 
					this home and robbed it of the greatest Jewel that had ever 
					shone there. It was the mother. And like a thief in the 
					night he did not tarry but claimed his own in abut thirty 
					minutes time after her had his final call. When stricken she 
					called for help and told the family she<br>
					was dying. The end came about eleven o'clock. This was a 
					great shock to all of her children who were not expecting 
					her death, and also her friends. Heart failure was the 
					cause. Another loving voice is hushed in silence, and her 
					long days work has been well done. And while the children 
					cannot come home to see their mother any more they can have 
					another family reunion on a brighter shore. She was 
					sixty-seven years old on Sept. 15 and was the last charter 
					member of the Presbyterian Church at the Chapel that was 
					organized in 1872 and where her body was conveyed to its 
					last resting place Thursday afternoon, where a large crowd 
					of sympathizing friends had assembled. Re. J. T. Wade 
					conducted services, while Miss May McCracken presided at the 
					organ. On arriving at the Chapel the first members of the 
					family that we met were Mrs. Maxie Aymett and Mrs. Lucy 
					Curtis with their husbands. The girls represented the 
					picture of grief, and when we shook hands with them all, 
					Maxie said, &quot;Mr. Turner this is awful.&quot; They reminded me of 
					our Saviour as he stood by the grave weeping for those he 
					loved. So in him we have the picture of both human and 
					divine blended in grief and to us this is a beautiful 
					picture. In fact, we have seen worse pictures in this world 
					than that of grief. And we decided that is good for us to 
					sometimes have the fountain of grief opened up in our souls, 
					while tears unbidden flow, for it brings us down to where we 
					can look up to Him and say in pensive tones, Our Father who 
					art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy name, They Kingdom come Thy 
					will be done, On Earth as it is in Heaven.&quot; Peace and love 
					were the dominant traits in her character and the life of 
					Mrs. Watson had been as tranquil, smooth, as a calm sea, and 
					like the rose of summer had shed its fragrances on all who 
					come in contact with her, one gave to the world some noble 
					sons and daughters to be our friends and neighbors. And we 
					hope that the dear friends will realize that to her death 
					was only the gateway to the morning of eternal day, where 
					she will bloom forever.<br>

					croup, after a few hours illness, aged about three years, 
					and was buried at Young�s Chapel, Sunday afternoon. She was 
					the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Wright of Bradshaw. It is 
					not pleasant to stand at the door of an open grave, and hear 
					the wail and sobs of a broken hearted father and mother but 
					they should find consolation in the fact that their little 
					darling has exchanged a home of earthly property for a home 
					of heavenly riches. And if we could all make this change it 
					would be better for us. We sympathize with Mr. and 
					Mrs.Wright in their sorrow.<br>
