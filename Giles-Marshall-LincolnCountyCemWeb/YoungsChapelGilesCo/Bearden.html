					Quite a sad death occurred near here Wednesday morning. Mr. 
					Jim Bearden, after eating breakfast, as usual, started to 
					work. On crossing a bridge near the house he was seized with 
					a hard seizure and fell into the water on his face, and 
					although the water was very shallow, he was drowned before 
					any one discovered him.<br>
