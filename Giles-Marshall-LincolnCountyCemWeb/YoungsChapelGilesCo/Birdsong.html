					Obituary: The Pulaski Citizen 24 Sep 1944<br/>
					On September 24, 1944, at 4:00 p.m., the Young's Chapel 
					Presbyterian Communities lost one of its eldest and best 
					loved members in the death of Mrs. Ellla Hollis Birdsong. 
					She was born in 1863. Early in life she became a Christian 
					and lived all her life in this community. From early in life 
					she continued to grow in grace, knowledge, love for God. She 
					was married to Ben Birdsong, who preceded her in death about 
					2 years ago. Together they embellished a Christian home into 
					which were born ten children, the lives of whom testified to 
					the sterling qualities of her character. She leaves eight 
					children, three sons and five daughters, also seventeen 
					great-grandchildren and a host of relatives and friends to 
					mourn their loss. She won a place in the hearts of all who 
					knew her, by her constant Christian life and interest in the 
					welfare of all in the community. As a wife and mother, she 
					was faithful in teaching her family by precept and example the 
					way of a noble life. She was always optimistic and possessed 
					a sweet, kind and lovable disposition, and a spirit to get 
					along with people. So not only her family but all who knew 
					her will call her blessed. She was a faithful Christian and 
					a constant attendant upon the worship services of Young's 
					Chapel Presbyterian Church. Her greatness was seen in the 
					inner life she lived, rather than the outward. Her memory is 
					engraved upon the hearts of her loved ones and will be a 
					source of comfort and strength for many years to come. "In 
					our hearts there is a picture more precious than silver or 
					gold; It's the picture of our dear mother, and it will 
					never, never grow old.<br/>
