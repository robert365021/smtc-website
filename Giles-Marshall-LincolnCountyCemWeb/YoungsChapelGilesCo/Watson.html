					Mrs. Fannie Watson is no more. A short time ago we wrote up 
					the Watsons reunion and also a sketch of this subject and we 
					heard that she was well pleased with what we said and now it 
					will not be necessary to repeat some things said on that 
					occasion. On Wednesday night, Dec. 19, 1917, death came to 
					this home and robbed it of the greatest Jewel that had ever 
					shone there. It was the mother. And like a thief in the 
					night he did not tarry but claimed his own in about thirty 
					minutes time after she had his final call. When stricken she 
					called for help and told the family she
					was dying. The end came about eleven o'clock. This was a 
					great shock to all of her children who were not expecting 
					her death, and also her friends. Heart failure was the 
					cause. <br>
					Another loving voice is hushed in silence, and her 
					long days work has been well done. And while the children 
					cannot come home to see their mother any more they can have 
					another family reunion on a brighter shore. She was 
					sixty-seven years old on Sept. 15 and was the last charter 
					member of the Presbyterian Church at the Chapel that was 
					organized in 1872 and where her body was conveyed to its 
					last resting place Thursday afternoon, where a large crowd 
					of sympathizing friends had assembled. Re. J. T. Wade 
					conducted services, while Miss May McCracken presided at the 
					organ. On arriving at the Chapel the first members of the 
					family that we met were Mrs. Maxie Aymett and Mrs. Lucy 
					Curtis with their husbands. The girls represented the 
					picture of grief, and when we shook hands with them all, 
					Maxie said, &quot;Mr. Turner this is awful.&quot; They reminded me of 
					our Saviour as he stood by the grave weeping for those he 
					loved. So in him we have the picture of both human and 
					divine blended in grief and to us this is a beautiful 
					picture. In fact, we have seen worse pictures in this world 
					than that of grief. And we decided that is good for us to 
					sometimes have the fountain of grief opened up in our souls, 
					while tears unbidden flow, for it brings us down to where we 
					can look up to Him and say in pensive tones, Our Father who 
					art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy name, They Kingdom come Thy 
					will be done, On Earth as it is in Heaven.&quot; Peace and love 
					were the dominant traits in her character and the life of 
					Mrs. Watson had been as tranquil, smooth, as a calm sea, and 
					like the rose of summer had shed its fragrances on all who 
					come in contact with her, one gave to the world some noble 
					sons and daughters to be our friends and neighbors. And we 
					hope that the dear friends will realize that to her death 
					was only the gateway to the morning of eternal day, where 
					she will bloom forever.<br>
