					Obituary: The Pulaski Citizen 27 Jul 1905<br>
					Dr. J. Frank Grant, who for a number of years was a well 
					known physician in Nashville, and who served with 
					distinction as soldier and surgeon in the army of the 
					Confederacy, died Saturday at the Old Soldiers' Home on the 
					Lebanon Road. He had been an inmate of that institution for 
					several years, in fact, ever since his health failed him and 
					he was forced to retire from the practice of his profession. 
					Dr. Grant, who had attained the rank of major at the close 
					of the Civil War, was born in Lincoln County in September 
					1837. He came from a fine old family in Southern Tennessee, 
					and married into one of the most prominent Giles County 
					families. His wife being Miss Julia Mayes, daughter of the 
					late Dr. Mayes. Mrs. Grant died several years ago, and was 
					buried in Giles at her old home. Dr. Grant enlisted in Co. 
					I, Thirty second Tennessee Infantry, in June 1861, and was 
					later transferred to the 3rd Tennessee, of which he was 
					surgeon. He was captured at Fort Donelson in February 1862, 
					and exchanged in September 1862. Later he was surgeon of 
					Brown's Brigade and of Brown's Division. He was paroled at 
					Greensboro, N. C. May 1, 1865, and as stated above attained 
					the rank of major. About fifteen years ago he removed to 
					Nashville and successfully practiced medicine. In addition 
					to being a very fine surgeon, he was a physician of note. 
					Dr. Grand had an office in East Nashville for a number of 
					years, and later located in the central part of the city. No 
					children resulted from his marriage. Dr. Grant was an 
					interesting raconteur, and in additions to the war stories 
					he related, he knew many of the inside facts regarding the 
					celebrated Ku Klux Klan. Dr. Grant's body was brought here 
					Sunday night and buried at Young's Chapel Monday, a large 
					number of old soldiers attending. The body of Dr. Grant's 
					wife who was buried at the Mayes place at Bradshaw was 
					disinterred and buried beside Dr. Grant.<br>
