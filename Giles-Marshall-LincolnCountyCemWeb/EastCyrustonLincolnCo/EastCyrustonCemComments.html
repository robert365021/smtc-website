		John Milliken (I), married Isabella Doak, 27 Sep 1786, in Augusta Co., 
		Virginia. They farmed in Lincoln Co. TN. Their son John Milliken II 
		(b.1791) most likely inherited the land from his father in 1814. He is 
		listed in the Lincoln Co. census from 1820 thru 1860 when he and son 
		John H. are using the Viney Grove P.O. In 1870 John H. Milliken is 
		listed at the Cyruston Posted Office.<br>
		<br>
		I've not located John Milliken II, but John H. Milliken, 1832-1872, is 
		buried at the Bethel cemetery, memorial# 64046987.<br>
		<br>
		I have found Millikens' in the Barnes and Bethel cemeteries, but I've 
		not located John Milligan (I) and his wife Isabella Doak, 1786-1803. It 
		could be they were buried on the old farm or the tombstones have simply 
		succumbed to time and/or they could be here at the East Cyruston 
		Cemetery under the same circumstances.<br>
		<br>
		It's odd that Findagrave.com has a listing for this cemetery, but no 
		memorials. This abandoned cemetery is not in the counties cemetery book, 
		but I'm told it does exist. So, I'm posting this memorial and hoping to 
		find out more information. (It is not there because most of the cemetery 
		listings in the Marsh book of the county did not include black 
		cemeteries or cemeteries thought to be black when in fact there may have 
		been old white graves which were unmarked.)</font></b></p>

<b><font face="Courier New" color="#800080"><u>Commentary by CW Austin:<br>
</u>&nbsp; The Millikens' could be interred here. If so their graves are 
unmarked. Their graves fall generally earlier than when headstones were first 
imported into the south, mostly quarried from the Missouri hill country. The East 
&amp; West Cryuston is a large community of land area spanning down the Old Elkton 
Pike from Swan Creek westward nearly to Dellrose. There are many possibilities 
of land ownership in that area. Whereas there are really no recognizable villages 
that grew up around these names, the East Cyruston community is concentrated around 
the junction of Swan Creek Rd and Old Elkton Pike (Hwy 273) near where this 
cemetery is located. There was a Post office in the 1800s there. This is also 
the place where the Swan Creek crosses the Pike on its bubbly travels south to 
empty into the Elk River a 1/2 mile south of East Cyruston. Many of the Milliken 
descendents have marked graves and are interred in the Bethel Cemetery 2+ miles 
to the northeast of East Cryuston along Gunter Hollow Road. <br>
<br>
I am sure in time this cemetery was discontinued by the African American 
Community for the nearby Antioch Church cemetery a 1/2 mile east of here, 
because of ownership and access reasons.<br>

From C. Wayne Austin</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Yesterday I visited the 
East Cryuston Cemetery as per your write-up on Findgrave.com. My conclusions are 
flavored with an archeological &amp; historical geographical perspective and should 
give you a way to figure out more about whether or not your Millicans were 
buried here. I have my conclusions in a bullet listing below:<br>
<br>
1. The gravestones that exist there belong to the African American community. 
One can tell black cemeteries by certain characteristics, in spite of not being 
able to tell otherwise as I made no attempt to find a caretaker. That 
identification largely centers around the amount of resources available for 
graves &amp; markers etc. in old times. So its not likely you are related to them.<br>
2. As per when white families of the Old Plantation culture died away and were 
buried on their places, I could not prove any of that with the grave records 
because the grave space is covered in brush and plant growth as dense as any I 
have seen. It was so dense I could see hardly anything and was lucky to find 
about 15 recent gravestones (averaging about 1920) for the black families.<br>
3. Analyzing the Topography shows this area marked on the maps to be the highest 
and therefore the most desirable grave area as all the other places on that 700+ 
land space identified below<br>
4. The cemetery is not presented in the Marsh Cemetery book because they did not 
include the black cemeteries and no information came to light that East Cyruston 
Cemetery could have been a white cemetery before blacks last used it as a burial 
ground. From the looks of things it is no longer active and has not seen 
visitors in years.<br>
5. The cemetery space is at least 2 to 3 acres and gravestones populate only a 
small part of that with grave sinks common to black burial methods being 
primarily located in the eastern part of the space, but the marked and unmarked 
graves are scattered along a line east to west near the south side of the space. 
Granite markers and one concrete marker of the Leatherwood surname are used in 
the western part and older limestone markers in the east with one concrete 
marker barely readable in the area close to the gate. The higher part of the 
cemetery is better suited for graves but shows no gravestones and is in the 
north area. As I say though I could not tell much because of the brush if there 
were old fallen stones for white settlers or even if they had only fieldstones 
or just plain unmarked graves. Also, I did not linger long due to having several 
cemeteries on my visitation platter that day.<br>
6. The farm though is used as a cattle feed lot and also serves the big bird 
community as a buzzard roost leaving me desirous of getting the heck out of 
there asap. Actually the Buzzard Roost was over next to the barn. but the smell 
from the hot south wind drifted into the cemetery and was horrific to my 
citified nose.<br>
7. The East Cyruston cemetery is completely abandoned, but is well fenced and 
gated on the southeast corner. It was clearly named with a community name and 
that probably was something the African American Community did to establish it 
as a community designation and would have been their way of taking control of 
the grave space. If there are whites buried that was done long after anyone had 
forgotten who started the graveyard. <br>
8. But I believe the place could have been owned by white families prior to 
blacks using recent tombstones. The farm looks to be in white's hands today 
though that is unimportant as a deciding factor. It could be that the white 
families all died out and/or moved away and the portion marked on maps as the 
East Cyruston Cemetery had its beginning as an old white family cemetery with a 
slave section which later was converted to an all African American (community) 
Cemetery.<br>
9. It is apparent that the farm in that area would have been hugely in demand as 
an agriculture land plot. It sits at the junction of the Elk River and the Swan 
Creek to the Gunter Hollow Road having highly prized soils for great crops and farming. So if one can 
identify what white family owned that plot in the early 1800s then they are on 
the path to figuring out who lived there and is likely buried there in now 
unmarked plots. I do believe on that space was prized as a cemetery space and 
would have been chosen to be used as a burial ground for any early farmer living 
there in the early 1800s.<br>
An old 1876 DG beers map would tell you something in the 1876 time era, but that 
was a bit late. That name and area would be plotted on the map. I don't have 
this map for Lincoln Co., but do for other counties around.<br>
10. This plot of farm land is unique in that the plot here is an old farm 
bounded by the road on the east, The Elk River on the southwest and the Swan 
Creek on the west. A small branch actually bounds the land space on the south &amp; 
east area and all that would encompass about 700 acres of land. That along with 
the very adequate water supply from the streams makes this is a very desirable 
land space and you can bet a prominent early settler secured at least that area 
for agriculture assuming they had land grants big enough or the ability to 
consolidate purchased grants of the whole area under one ownership.<br>
<br>
With your help I might like to recreate this cemetery on findagrave and add some 
of the above info/writing into the Cemetery menu page for anyone interested in 
this cemetery. You can transfer your listings to that and I will add all the 
African Americans gravestones. I do believe it is necessary to designate the 
race of those interred here because to correctly tell the history and to help 
out in the genealogy area. After we vacate the old listing on findagrave.com 
which now only has your two Millicans the blank one could be deleted as that is 
all there is now in that listing.<br>
