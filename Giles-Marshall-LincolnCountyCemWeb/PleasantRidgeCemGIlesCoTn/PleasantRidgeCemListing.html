<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #008080">Thursday morning at 10 o�clock 
the death angel came to the home of Mrs. Charlie Moore and gathered the soul of 
her little sweet daughter Oderbelle, upon its snowy wings and wafted it back to 
the blessed Saviour who gave it. �Obbie� as she was known to everyone was twelve 
years eight months and a few days old. Just in the bloom of her youth but God 
saw best to call her home so she just paid the debt that we all owe. &nbsp;Some say 
she had TB and others say it was pneumonia and her tonsils. So we were not 
certain what it was. She was a sweet and loving girl and to know her was to love 
her. All her schoolmates loved her. She was always so kind and good at school. 
After funeral services by Rev. E. E. Eddings she was laid to rest in Pleasant 
Ridge Cemetery. Her girl schoolmates were pall bearers. Weep not dear loved ones 
for sweet �Obbie� is not dead, but only asleep in the arms of the dear Saviour. 
She cannot come back to us but we can go to meet her if only we believe and obey 
God�s will. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #008080">Death is sad at all times, but 
when our loved ones are taken away from us almost without warning, it seems very 
sad indeed. &nbsp;Uncle George Norwood is dead! &nbsp;This was the sad news that went 
ringing over our land and country on last Monday, September 3, and it was oh 
such a shock to his dear old brothers and sisters and children. &nbsp;Altho not 
feeling as well as usual, uncle George had attended a graveyard working at 
Pleasant Ridge on Saturday and on Sunday was walking about the place singing as 
usual. &nbsp;Monday he complained of feeling bad and lay down across the bed, his 
granddaughter, Miss Dezzie Rutherford, asked him if he wanted a drink of water, 
and he replied, &quot;No Dezzie. &nbsp;I just want to rest, let me rest awhile&quot;, and with 
those words, he was gone to rest forever more. &nbsp;Uncle George was born Dec. 27, 
1835, being at his death, 87 years, 8 months and 7 days old, although a long 
time to stay in this old world of sin and sorrow, he was very active and no one 
had more friends than Uncle George. &nbsp;He was another one of our good old Civil 
War Veterans and was a member of the Masonic Lodge and had been a member of the 
Methodist church for over 40 years. &nbsp;He leaves behind to mourn his going away, 
his last wife, three brothers and two sisters, J. A. Norwood of Petersburg, 
Tenn., E. T. of Shannon Creek and J. H. who now makes his home on Clear Creek, 
{Rest of obituary was missing.} &nbsp;The two sisters were, Mrs. Mary Tabitha Coffman 
of Ala., and Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson of Minor Hill. &nbsp;His children, I know that 
were still living were, Cornelia M. Garner, Ann Jane Anderson, Martha Frances Rackley, Levi Edmund Norwood, Joseph Mitchell Norwood, and George Thomas 
Norwood.</span></p>
