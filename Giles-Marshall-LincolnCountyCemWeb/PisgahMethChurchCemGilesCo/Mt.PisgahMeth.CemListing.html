<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">the part of the mother's family came peace,

<span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">of life he passed out from the walks of men

<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">He was my neighbor and friend. From 
childhood happy hours up to 36 years of age, when he folded his arms in death, I 
knew him. 'Tis not extravagant neither a lavish compliment to say I never knew a 
purer man. Through the mirror of retrospection I have surveyed his life since 
death. </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">I never knew of any one 
speaking unkindly of him. Peace and prudence seemed to have been his </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.25pt">watch words in life. Such a rich character 
as his is not the product of an hour or day, neither a week or a year but an 
abundant accumulation of a life time. Several years ago realizing that his
</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.5pt">morals and up-rightness would not 
meet the full measurement of time and eternity he professed </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.55pt">religion and thereafter lived a most

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">On the morning of 
October 5, 1904, Capt. B. M. Burch passed quietly away. He was born </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">August 2, 1836, and departed this life 
October 5, 1904, age 68 years, 2 months and 3 days. His </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">remains were laid to rest at <b>Pisgah </b>
in the presence of his sorrowing family, one only, his </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.55pt">youngest son, being absent in Texas. He was 
married Dec. 2, 1862 to Miss Mary M. Black, who </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">together with her eight children survive 
him. During their wedded life of 42 years, death had </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.55pt">never invaded their home until deceased 
passed away. He professed religion at New Zion 18 years </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">ago, and&nbsp; joined the Methodist Church at 
Friendship. His was an unusually quiet life. He lived not </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">to be praised of by the world, or to win 
honor as the world calls honor, but passed the days as </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">they came and went in peacefully and quietly 
discharging his duties as he conscientiously saw them. His life was based upon 
principles of right and wrong. He loved his fellowman and trusted </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.6pt">him completely. He was a pure man, honest 
and truthful; free from all cunning and deceit. He was </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">patient, long suffering, kind and 
benevolent. No one called upon him in vain when he was able to help. For the 
past eight or ten years of his life his mind has been impaired, hardly 
perceptible </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.55pt">at first, but as each 
year passed leaving him worse than the preceding one, until he finally became
</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">totally unconscious of what he did. 
He became in his last days very restless and would wander </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.5pt">from home in all kinds of weather, 
regardless of the entreaties of his family. Not being able to care for him 
properly at home he was carried last August to Central Hospital, Nashville. He 
was doing well until Sunday before his death, when he suddenly fell due to heart 
trouble to which he never rallied. A good husband, a kind father and a harmless 
citizen has gone, and God in his tender love </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">and mercy has taken him home.</span></p>

<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">He professed religion at Pisgah when only 
sixteen years of age and lived a consistent Christian </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.25pt">life. He was a man of fine character, with 
a kind and sweet disposition, always cheerful and </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">seemed to be happy, and tried to make 
everybody about him happy. Of course, he had his </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.25pt">troubles like other men, also sorrow and 
grief, temptations and disappointments but was so </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">confident of the fact that &quot;all things work 
together for good to those that love the Lord,&quot; that he </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">always looked on the bright side of every 
thing. He was always willing and ready to help those that needed help. He was 
conscious until the very last and left this testimony. &quot;I'm going he; </span>

won, and I can meet God in peace.&quot; With true </span>

&quot;like one who wraps the drapery of his couch about </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.5pt">him and lies down to pleasant dreams.&quot; When 
the end came it was sweetly calm and beautifully </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">peaceful. Tis a sad thought to realize that 
he is dead, but we must not think of him as being dead, </span>

</i></b><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">Bunker Hill---On April 7, the infant babe of 
Mr. and Mrs. Reuben Roddie quietly passed into sweet life beyond, aged 7 months 
and one day. Marco was a sweet innocent little babe and was as smart a child as 
I ever saw to be so young. Little Marco had been suffering untold agony for
</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">the last two weeks with whooping 
cough and pneumonia and fatal results followed, carrying the little infant to 
its long, long home. The first link has been broken in this once happy family 
circle and the shadows rest deeply where recently all was sunshine. Loving 
parents and kind friends did all they could, but God took him home to be with 
loved ones gone on before. If he had lived he </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">would have been subjected to the sins and 
sorrows of life. The funeral services were conducted by Rev. Shaw, of Elkton, at 
the homestead, after which he was carried to Pisgah and laid to rest </span>

Smith died at his home near McBurg, July 8, 1911, age 78 years, and was buried Monday at <b>Pisgah</b>. He and Mrs. 
Smith were sick all last winter, and he came forth last </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">spring in a feeble condition. He had gained 
sufficient strength to drive to Petersburg, and was </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">in McBurg on the day his leg was broken, on 
returning home. From this hurt tetanus set up </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">that resulted in his death. He was never a 
very strong man physically, but had a fine intellect and was a good reasoner. 
Like all of us he had his faults and sins, but had found rest from all </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">the sins by believing in the finished work 
of Christ. He believed that the atoning merit of the </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">Son of God was all sufficient to save him 
from his sins and believing this he had fought a good </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">fight and kept the faith. True he was an 
ambitious man, but the indwelling of the Holy Spirit </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.25pt">had toned up his life, and demonstrated to 
the world through him that there is a reality in the </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.1pt">religion of Christ. He was identified with 
the Primitive Baptists at New Hope Church and </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">fidelity to his church and family and 
friends was one of his strongest and greatest points. But </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">there is no greater point in human life that 
fidelity to family and church and friends. We never met him and took his hand, 
and looked into that keen penetrating eye, that we did not feel conscious of the 
fact that great soul was living in the &quot;earthy house.&quot; R. G. Myers of Dellrose,
</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">who knew his life and had lived at 
this door for twenty years spoke at the residence and paid him a very high 
eulogy, when the said that he had tried him and knew that he was an honest
</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.1pt">man. Elder Jim Britton also made a 
few brief remarks at the cemetery. He leaves a wife and </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">four children: Mrs. Nevels in Texas, Mrs.

<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">God bless this family and all who may read 
this tribute to &quot;Rockey&quot; John Smith, who has bid </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="letter-spacing: -.1pt">On Thursday morning, 
April 8th &quot;Curg&quot; Smith left home on foot and told his wife that he </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">would be at home that night. He came to 
Woodrow to see Mr. and Mrs. Sam Curtis, his wife's niece, and left on the three 
o'clock train for Frankewing. But told Mr. Curtis that he would not </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">come back on the night train to go home as 
he had told his wife he would do, but would go </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.25pt">across the Sutton farm from Frankewing. 
This was nearer than going the public road. We saw </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">him at Frankewing and expressed surprise at 
seeing him out as he had been confined to his </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">room for some time. But he said he had 
already walked to see cousin Hortense Campbell. He </span>left Frankewing and 
the public road and on our return home we passed in the lane at
<span style="letter-spacing: -.05pt">Bradshaw Creek at the gate that leads 
across the grass lot bottom on the Sutton farm. We </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">asked him if he could cross the little creek 
that flows across the bottom and he said he could. This was the last time he was 
seen alive, between four and five in the afternoon. His wife sat </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">up late expecting him home but finally 
decided that he was spending the night at Woodrow </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">and retired but said she dreamed that he was 
calling her and awoke to hear it raining. Friday </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">morning when he failed to come home she sent 
Jack Watson to Woodrow. Mr. Curtis knew the way he said he was going home and we 
told Mr. Curtis where we had passed him on our </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">way home. So they went across the bottom and 
little creek and found him dead in a small </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">ditch. From his tracks he had attempted to 
recross the ditch to get a can of paint he had set </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">down. He was stretched out full length face 
down, his feet against one bank and his body on </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">the other bank, and there were no evidence 
that he had moved but expired in a short time in </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.25pt">the same position in which he fell. He was 
71 years of age and no one who knew him was </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">surprised because he had failed to get up 
without help, for that had been his misfortune for </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.25pt">several years. We all regret that he died 
this way but he was childish and his wife could not </span>
<span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt">control him. But there was no evidence of 
foul play and the evidence was conclusive that he met death accidentally. He had 
been married twice, his first wife was Miss Martha Woodard </span>
