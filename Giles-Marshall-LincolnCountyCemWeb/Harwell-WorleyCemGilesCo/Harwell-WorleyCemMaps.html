X W -86.87154.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="Harwell-WorleyCemRd.jpg"><br>
From Pulaski go east on Hwy 64 toward I-65. At the junction while still on Hwy 
64 on the west side of I-65 take the access road left (north) and go 1/2 mile to 
a home. The cemetery is on the right (north) side of the home in the pasture 
just across the fence line. You will only see minimal evidence of a cemetery here 
as noted on the menu page mainly because the owner of the land keeps it  
mowed down as a pasture. He does not wish it to grow up as a thicket. This is the instructions given in the Giles County Tennessee 
Cemetery book about 1988 </font><font color="#800000" size="2">Location: Hwy 64E, left into access road at interstate on Fly Farm. 
The gentleman said he had lived here 60 years so might we assume he is Mr. Fly?</font><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
