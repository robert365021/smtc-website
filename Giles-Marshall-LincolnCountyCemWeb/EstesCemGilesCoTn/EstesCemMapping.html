</b></font><b><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Courier New">Location: Go 
northeast on Hwy 31 Alt to the New providence Community on the left to Sumac 
Road on the right and turn right. Go to the 2nd house on the left (old house). 
The cemetery is past but behind the house about 200 yards NE out in the pasture.</font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Courier New"> 
Alternate instructions: Go 31A, turn right on Sumac Road just after going down a hill and across the 
bridge there is a house on the left where you turn into the driveway (with 
permission). The farmer here is making a mistake. He is turning the cemetery 
into a cattle service station. This will destroy what is left of this cemetery 
over time.</font></b><b><font color="#000080" size="4"><font face="Courier New"><br>
<img border="0" src="EstesCemView.jpg"><br>
This view from Google shows the tree towering above the cemetery which cannot be 
seen for the other trees in our view. The cemetery is not at the fence line seen 
near that old vehicle but, that point is about 1/2 way to the cemetery across a 
fence line.</font><i><font face="Courier New"><br>
