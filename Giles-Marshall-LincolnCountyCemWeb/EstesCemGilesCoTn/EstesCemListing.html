Unknown pile of stones, 
some may have marked graves before they were collected up. Others may come from 
the surrounding field. We know there are graves here for folks that rest beneath 
this sod who have no formally inscribed marker:<a href="IMG_8349.JPG">8349</a></b></p>
<p><b>Some Estes graves were marked with fieldstones 
which have been removed to make way for cattle ranching.<br>
<br>
According to Jean Cosby (a knowledgeable historian of Giles County) her friend lived here at one time. They surveyed this cemetery 
together several years ago. 
The friend is now deceased 
and the place sold - new owner unknown. She described the cemetery 
as in a field just (back) north of the house.<br>
<br>
Now this cemetery does not appear to be in the company of folks that at one time 
were prominent in Giles County circles. Don't ever let the current circumstances 
of a cemetery and remains of an old home taint your attitude. Changes are always 
in force that break every thing back down to its simplest state. I go to many 
cemeteries only to find the home is a mansion and the cemetery has been trashed 
knowing that the folks in the trashed cemetery lived in the home long years ago.</b></p>
