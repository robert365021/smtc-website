  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville go around the 
		eastern bypass to Hwy 64. Turn right on Hwy 64 toward Winchester. Go a 
		couple of miles and turn left (north) on the Marrs Road and circle 
		around about 400 yards to the third house on the left. This is the first 
		house past Old Mulberry Road junction on the right. ) With permission go 
		up the driveway to the end and over the fence. The Gate is at the end of 
		the concrete driveway. You are sitting beside another building behind 
		the house and the gate is locked so don't even go here with advance 
		notice to the owner.  <br/>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery under the trees but behind a secondary 
		building behind the main house. I cannot over emphasize permission, 
		because this cemetery is in someone's back yard and is being maintained 
		as part of the premises.</font></b><font size="2"><br/>
