<div>I did a little more looking on Asenath Black.  Can&#39; find why I thought she married Anderson Hogan.</div>
<div>They must of married between 1850 and died before 1870.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My brother-in-law owns the old farm she and 
	Nicholas Hale owned, near Puncheon.  Doubt he knows it. ha</div>
<div><br>
	Anderson Hogan lived near Sugar Creek bridge which is on HWY 11.  By some reason I remember she married him in later years. This 
	info was probably found in Chancery court Records.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Asenath received land from the Black family, I know I remember seeing that.</div>

	See below this letter:<br>
	<br>
	Found this on ancestry.com. Hope it comes through.<br>
	They only named one son for Robert.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Beside John and Jerome I know there was one daughter I 
	remember. She married a Hale, then Anderson Hogan. Trying to remember.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
	<p>There was s Frank Black, that lived at Minor Hill and ran 
	a store at his home. A road turns right in front of this pre Civil War barn 
	near the Black Cemetery that went out by Frank Black&#39;s store and home. I 
	think Robert Black owned a lot of land going back a ways on each of Highway 
	11 there. Now Frank could of been John&#39;s brother or son, can&#39;t remember. I 
	have heard Frank has a descendant living in Columbia that did research on 
	that family.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Rost Jewerly Store owners in Pulaski descends from the 
	Minor Hill Blacks. I use to ask Lucille Rost about the Appleton family which 
	she descended from and my husband did. Then gave her son&#39;s wife material I 
	had on both Appleton and Black family.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The Rost family let me borrow pictures of the house you 
	see when you first go off Minor Hill down below the hill. This was built by 
	the Yarbroughs. Mrs. Yarbrough was a Black is who the Rost family descends 
	from.<br>
