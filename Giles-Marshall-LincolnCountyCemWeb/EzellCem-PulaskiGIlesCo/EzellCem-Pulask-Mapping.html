</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080">Location: Go east out Old Hwy 15 
aka East Jefferson Street 
aka Beech Hill Rd, Pulaski). Cemetery on the left. Enclosed 
by a rock wall, back of what used to be Patterson's Used Car lot about 350 yards 
north of the road.<br>
Jean Cosby says you have to go through 
a gate or climb a Fence to get to it. It is up the hill behind the house. I 
visited this cemetery by access from the pleasant and gracious neighbor on the 
west side of the property. According to her most visitors to this cemetery use 
their long curvy driveway since the cemetery is just over the fence from their 
property. No gate climbing necessary, just slide under the fence. You will see 
the rock wall.<br>
