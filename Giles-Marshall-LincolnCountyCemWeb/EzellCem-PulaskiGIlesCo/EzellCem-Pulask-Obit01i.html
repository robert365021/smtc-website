<br>
John Henry Ezell, a brother of Mace died Wednesday, July 9, at the home of his 
sister, Mrs. Pink Seely, Nashville, and was buried in the Ezell family cemetery 
here from the home of his brother, Mace Ezell Thursday, with funeral services 
conducted by Rev. M. S. Kennedy. He had been for some time an inmate of the old 
Soldier�s Home near Nashville, and on July 4, walked to the railroad station, a 
distance of about three miles, to come into Nashville and participate in the 
celebration to raise funds for a monument to the private soldier. He was 
overheated by the walk and death was the result. John H. Ezell joined Capt. Hume 
R. Fields� company made up here in Pulaski, April 1861, and was with the company 
until the battle of Mission Ridge where he was severely wounded twice in the 
right leg. He was incapacitated for service and joined Sykes communiary 
department remaining with him until 1865. He was loved by every member of his 
company and regiment, often doing acts of kindness to comrades.<br>
