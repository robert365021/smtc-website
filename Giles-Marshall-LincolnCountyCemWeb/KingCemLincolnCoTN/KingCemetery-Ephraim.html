Do any of the King descendants know if Ephraim King, 1785 - 1845 is really 
buried in the King Cemetery. Did he live here in the latter days of his life - 
on the 1840 Census? Who was his wife &amp; what happened to her. Does she show up in 
the 1840 census? A guy named &quot;The Mikado, et al. added him in the King Cemetery. 
I have crossed paths with him in the past. He does good work.  </span>

- In my case and I believe in most King descendants cases we received most of 
our information on our King ancestors from Mildred King Moore and Tom Jackson 
King SR. As both were up in age when I started doing genealogy 20 years ago when 
I was first in contact with them, I do not believe they are with us any more. 
Family tradition has that Ephraim King SR is buried in the King cemetery. 
However the 1840 census does not have him in dist 10. I would have to look that 
up but believe it was dist 3. Do not know why unless dist 3 included what became 
dist 10. Correction, Ephraim King appears in dist 15 on the 1840 census. But do 
believe the dist lines moved not the King land.</span></b></p>

From that Ephraim is most likely in the King Cem. However he still may be in the 
Harkins Cemetery. The oldest graves there (Harkins) are Wm &amp; Margaret Harkins 
Sorrell. She d. 1841 he d. 1870. If Kings &amp; Sorrells were not intermarried by 
then likely Ephraim founded the King Cemetery. This has to be an Archeological 
perspective because no records exist anymore to show the exact truth. It seems 
to me that Ephraim was a land trader because of the land trading he was involved 
in. Might have been moving around or the Dist. lines changed. Don't know, but 
likely they brought him and his wife's remains back to the first King land/first 
home at the King Cem to be buried. That is east of Petersburg and west of the 
Chestnut Ridge. If the descendants sold the land where Ephraim lived it is a bit 
unlikely he was buried on his own land if they sold it to another party unless 
it was family.  </span></b></p>

- William Sorrells married 1) Margaret Harkins (don�t know parents) and (2) 
Eleanor �Nellie� King, daughter of Ephraim King and Jane Harkins. Will check my

- Jane Harkins King died before 13 Feb 1862. That is the date of court records 
were my ggrandfather James Wright had to sue her son my g-grandfather Andrew 
Jackson King (her executor) as Jane had died. Jane sold land to James Wright in 
1859 but Jane did not have rights to the land. It went through the court for 
years because of the Civil War. During the War all papers of the court were 
lost. Therefore after the War James Wright had to start all over again with the 
suit. James Wright did get legal rights to the land. It was the family farm 
until he died in 1893. His land bordered Kings land to the north. I believe that 
Martha E King Armstrong (Andrew Jackson King's daughter &amp; my great grandmother) 
lived on the King land with her 4 children once she became a widow. Therefore my 
grandparents James &amp; Willie Etta Armstrong Wright were neighbors. Just a little 
romance speculation there LOL. James &amp; Rebecca Renfrow Wright are buried in the 
Harkins cemetery. Many people believe Jane Harkins King died in 1863. But that 
was the date that some of her land was being sold. I have from research that 
others have done that Jane Harkin King was born 1789 Pendleton South Carolina.

So is it understood Jane was born about 1788 or 1850 - Age 62. Going with that 
b. date unless someone disagrees. Opps you said 1789 so use that.</span></b></p>

-&nbsp; Yes, it is fine with me to publish on your site. This morning I have 
gone over the many papers from this law suit. It is very involved. The last 
paper where Jane Harkins King is still alive is dated 27 Aug 1861. On 13 Feb 
1862 is the first document where the court is filing the suit to Andrew Jackson 
King on behalf of James Wright. &quot;Where as one James Wright of Lincoln County in 
the Chancery Court of said County, against one Jane King, And where as the said 
Jane King has departed this life......&quot; The land belonged to John J Greer. Jane 
was to pay Greer with James Wright notes &amp; notes from Charles Chesser who 
purchased James Wright's land in Norris Creek. She did not do so. Finally on 25 
Nov 1866 James Wright purchase the land from John J Greer. Now the reason Jane 
does not appear on the 1860 census is because some of the dist 10 census is 
either missing or was not taken. James Wright does not appears on the 1860 
census as well. I have been in contact with others who ancestors in dist 10 are 
missing.  </span></b></p>

That nails down Jane King's death date down. Jane died between 27 Aug 1861 &amp; 13 
Feb 1862 or somewhere along a 6 or 7 months span. Anyway she should be in the 
King Cemetery beside her husband Ephraim and that is close enough for anyone to 
agree on since the King and Harkins Cems are only abut 100 yards apart. Neither 
of those graveyards were near full by then.  </span></b></p>

So I have in King Cem : King, Ephraim FAG#144510948, b. 1785 d. Jan. 10, 1845. 
and lots of Bio to follow. For Jane Harkins King, b 1789 d. between 27 Aug 1861 
to 13 Feb 1862. However FAG will not allow a posting of between death dates so I 
will use an average of 6 months and 17 days or 3 months and 8 days added to 27 
Aug 1861 or = Nov 5, 1861. and explain how this was arrived at in the notes. So 
use cir Nov 5, 1861 as a death date but explain it is an average calculated 
death date (cir) based on court documents and specify the dates. and I will use 
the d. between dates on my site. I don't have any constraints.  </span></p>
