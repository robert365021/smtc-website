Obituary: <br>
The Pulaski Citizen 9 Aug 1961 <br>
Funeral services for Harold Douglas Daly, seventeen-year-old Prospect High 
School senior who drowned in Elk River Friday night, August 4, were conducted at 
McConnell Funeral Home, Athens, Ala., Sunday afternoon at 2 o�clock. James E. 
Holt, Church of Christ minister, officiated and burial was in Daly Cemetery near 
Elkton. <br>
The youth was one of a group of young people who had gone swimming at Morrell�s 
Mill about 10 p. m., according to Bill Morris, Giles County chief deputy 
sheriff, who said he was told that Daly swam across the river and was returning 
when he disappeared at midstream. <br>
Linden Ward, one of the group, attempted to rescue Daly but was unable to fine 
him after he sank from view. Officers were notified and rescue operations were 
begun immediately. The body was recovered about 2 a. m. Saturday after being 
spotted by Butch Gibson a short distance downstream from where the youth had 
disappeared. <br>
The scene of the drowning is about 15 miles south of Pulaski and not far from 
Daly�s home just south of the Tennessee-Alabama state line. <br>
He was the son of Robert W. and Louise Bates Daly of Veto, Ala. <br>
Other survivors include two brothers, Roger Dale Daly of Veto and Donald Ray 
Daly of Nashville; one sister, Brenda Kay Daly of Veto; and his grandparents, 
Raymond Daly of Veto and Mr. and Mrs. Erskine Bates of Pettusville, Ark. <br>
