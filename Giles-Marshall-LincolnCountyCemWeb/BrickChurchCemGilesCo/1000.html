  This infant's box tomb is fallen and lies at the foot of a giant Oak
  Tree.&nbsp;<br>

  LAIRD, Infant daughter of R. H. &amp; N. M. Laird, 3 June 1847 - 15 June 1847.
  Inscription is faint but reads: SACRED -- to the -- memory of an Infant --
  Daughter of R. H. &amp; -- N. M. Laird who was -- born June 3rd &amp; died --
  June 15th 1847.&nbsp;<br>
  <i>That may look like 1817 but has a faint cross bar making it a 1847.&nbsp;Obviously
  this child was connected to Laird Family that lived in the now Lairdland
  Plantation home (now a bed and breakfast) down the road a few hundred yards.<br>
