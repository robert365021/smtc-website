  SMITH, Nannie, 1875 - 1924. (I think this is a black lady.)&nbsp;<br>
  That is a hunch based on where she is buried and the where the places are
  located for the other black ladies interred in similarly marked locations on
  the back or side of the church. This is the back side of the churchyard
  whereas Ms Whitfield and Ms Gordon were interred in the right side of the
  building where few marked graves are located.<br>
