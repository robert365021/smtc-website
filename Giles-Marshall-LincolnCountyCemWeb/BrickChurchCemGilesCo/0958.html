  <p><font size="2" color="#008000">There are 2 Thomas Kennedy Gordons in Giles
  County. One was born in 1792 and died in 1880. He was married to Betsy Lane.
  This Thomas Kennedy was son of Samuel &amp; Barbara Cameron Gordon who were in
  Maury County then moved to Giles County. This is the one that served with
  Jackson in the War of 1812.<br>
  <br>
  There is another Thomas Kennedy Gordon who was born in 1820-1830 time period
  &amp; is son of John &amp; Mary Ann Kennedy Gordon. This family is connected
  to the Samuel &amp; Barbara Cameron Gordon family too. These Gordons are not
  related to my Gordon family. The one mentioned as born in 1829 is this one
  here. Most of these early Gordons are buried in Brick Church Cemetery.<br>

  The memorial on the fence at Brick Church Cemetery cannot be for the Thomas
  Kennedy Gordon b. 1829 buried there. It should be at Lane Cemetery in Giles
  Co. for Col Thomas Kennedy Gordon. Note the memorial says he served with
  Andrew Jackson in War 1812. This Gordon wasn't yet born. What say you?<br>

  <p><font size="2">The above historical marker was not necessarily confirming
  Thomas Kennedy Gordon's (1792 - 1880) burial in Brick Church. That is just
  where they placed it for the Gordon family. Here below is the cropped inscription
  for the box tomb located in the dense thickets of the Lane Cemetery a few miles
  north here. I agree it is obvious these Gordon's were connected to those
  interred the Lane Cemetery. This Thomas K. Gordon would have been fighting age
  of 18-21.</font></p>
