  BARLAR, Willie Jones, wife of W.W. Barlar 19 January 1864 - 14 March 1886.
  (1st wife of William W. Barlar who married Blanch V. Gordon sometimes after
  Willie's death; had children, then left her for Wilburton, Oklahoma and
  &quot;struck oil and became wealthy&quot; so the story goes. He married Lela
  Wallace out there and she evidently was his heir. (Story as confirmed by 91
  years of age, Gypsy O'malley Eslick, granddaughter b. 1917 during 2008.). See
  listing Blanch V. Gordon Barlar buried also in this cemetery. This is a broken
  stone which was temporarily set up for photography and reset in a manner back
  like it was to preserve the inscriptions out of reach from the lawnmowers.&nbsp;<br>
