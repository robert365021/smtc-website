<b>This photo looks at north side of the cemetery
at the Dunlap area a
prominent and substantial family who settled in this neighborhood in more recent
times. One glance at the tombstones tells the story of how long ago they
inhabited this neighborhood.<br>

<b>We are looking at the memorials around the
sidewalk to the building. Don't ever discount the little child or mother's stone
just because they are the only surname in the cemetery. Often that is a real clue to your lost ancestors moving around. For instance look at this listing in this cemetery:
BROWN, Mary W., 7 Jun 1861 - 4 Mar 1897. &quot;Wife of J. E. Brown.&quot;. Now
by looking at the list it is obvious that Brown is not a prominent surname in this cemetery. However
for those looking for lost ancestors this may be a clue as to a family who was
here for a short time, maybe as the traveling minister of this church, who moved
on and became more prolific somewhere else. Chances are great that Mary Brown
died (as often happened) from female causes related to childbirth and R. E.
moved away&nbsp; and remarried and maybe became prolific somewhere else. Men
lived longer than women and children often died in childhood in the 1800s related to the complications
of childbirth and the infectious diseases. <br>
