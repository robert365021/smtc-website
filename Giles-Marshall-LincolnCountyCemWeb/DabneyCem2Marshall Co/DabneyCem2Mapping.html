From Exit 22 of I-65 go southeast on Hwy 31 Alt to Buford Station Road and turn 
right. Go a 3 tenths of a mile and turn right (north) into Hart Leonard Road. 
Follow that up the slope until it goes into Marshall County and bear right 
(east) on Hooker Rd aka Charlie Thomas Rd. That&nbsp; road goes back into 
Giles Co and then back into Marshall Co again changing road names. When the road turns 
90 degrees (right) toward the east go about 300 yards further and turn left up 
into the drive of 
the old Dabney Farm home road now belonging to others. The cemetery is between 
the house and road along the road. You will see it with the box tombs and other 
monuments on your left.<br>
