Reaves Cemetery is shown at GPS 35.35799 North by 86.4609 West. This is my 
calculation of the GPS. National Mapping shows the cemetery further south. I know that to be incorrect. 
When we include a map where an Aerial 
view shows the tree line. However, I do think I have a slight error. The cemetery 
is actually located about 50 feet south into that big clump of round trees.<br>

To find Reaves cemetery go south on Hwy 231 out of Shelbyville 4.7 miles from 
the Parkway bypass to New Center Church Road and turn south (right). Go 2.5 five miles 
and turn south onto Amos Gamble Road and follow that for 2.65 miles until you 
nearly terminate onto Goose Creek Road. Look left or due east and the cemetery 
is due east about 300 yards under the trees. This is land owned by Mr. Hastings 
today so he lives in the brick house above you off of he road.&nbsp; You may get 
permission from him or his son who lives in the house between the cemetery and 
the road.<br>

This Topographical Map shows the trees where the cemetery can be found marked by 
a red check.<br>

This Aerial view shows the clearest possible image of the trees under which you 
will find this cemetery. Just southwest of there is an old barn or home (not 
sure which) that has fallen in and was a substantial property at one time. It 
has a stone foundation still standing today.&nbsp;
