		It is strange seeing a cemetery sitting in a barn yard 
		like it belongs there. This reinforces the knowledge that folks dying 
		long ago and wanted to be buried on their home place, especially since 
		they worked so hard to build up the place did they want their remains to 
		stay of the premises. It has sure made it hard for the descending 
		generations. They have a graveyard when they need a farm space. In that 
		light many proceed to treat the cemetery like a part of the farming 
		operation. You know &quot;its jes some old busted rocks with names on them 
		over by the fence row.&quot; Few of the farmers have the interest and 
		resources to fence the cemetery and care for the gravestones as is 
		needed for the long term survival of the memorials. Fewer still, of the 
		many descendents, step in and offer a hand. Too often the descendents get 
		all worked up and go there and cut the brush and set up the stones; then 
		in short order forget the place which means it all reverts right back to 
		the state of abandonment such as rampant growth of trees uprooting the 
		graves and stones, fences fallen or trampled by livestock as they also 
		rub against the stones causing them to fall and break. Its a vicious 
		cycle of decline showing up on this site as stones not photographed and 
		in many case some not even known about, meaning totally unmarked graves. 
		We find them in the censuses and track them up to old age&nbsp; and 
		bingo there is no gravestone. Now in some case that is deliberate 
		because of the high cost of gravestones, even religious reasons, or 
		others putting a low value on life and memorials. In so many other cases 
		though the stone is lost to nature, neglect or even vandals.

Jun 2012 by C. Wayne Austin. Also published in the book Giles County Cemeteries, 
Page 371 by the Historical Society 1986. Presented on Findagrave.com with 
7 listings and one photo which I put there to satisfy a photo 
request. They also have the name wrong, as Mitchell-Coalson. There is an Coalson 
Abernathy for whom shares the name with Marcus Mitchell, so precisely the name 
in the Giles Co Cem book was Mitchell-Abernathy (Coalson) and I dropped the 
Coalson because in the interest of fairness I would need to give it this name: 
Mitchell (Marcus)-Abernathy (Coalson) Cem.</i></b></font></p>
