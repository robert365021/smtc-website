This map shows the coordinates of the Mitchell-Abernathy Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="Mitchell-AbernathyCemRd.jpg" width="1600" height="696"><br>
Directions to this cemetery: Go south on Hwy 31 from the 64 southern bypass one 
mile. The cemetery is found at the antebellum home across the road from the 
junction of Amos Hamlett Rd. With permission (or be shot on site. HA!) go into 
the driveway and follow the road north of the home to the barn and turn left 
into the pasture where the cemetery is on the north side of the barn. The gate 
into the pasture and cemetery are on the northeast corner of the barn. The barn 
is about 300 yards south of the home as seen in the below aerial map. <br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery on the north side of the barn. The road to the cemetery 
which is not seen on the north of this map also doubles as the road to the residence and also to the 
barn and farm operation so be 
sure you go here with deliberate upscale intentions and secure permission.<br>
