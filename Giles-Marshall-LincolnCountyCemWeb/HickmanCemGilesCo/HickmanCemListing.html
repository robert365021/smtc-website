<i>Judy King Sanders (the 
source author) and visitor of this cemetery in 1996 says the cemetery is not in 
good condition. It is an open cemetery and cows have been allowed to roam over 
it.&nbsp; Another source is the Giles County Cemetery Historical 
Society book.&nbsp; The GSC book say also that 
Elizabeth Hickman and husband J.B. Hickman (or Morrow) is interred here without 
headstones. They offered no listings for any other burials.&nbsp; Photo by John 
Colvett. Revised to add John's photos in May 2015<br>
