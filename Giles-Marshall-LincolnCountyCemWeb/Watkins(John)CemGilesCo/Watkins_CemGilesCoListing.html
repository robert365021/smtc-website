	<br>
	This cemetery is almost not recognizable as such with stones that were once 
	complete monument being now only fragments piled together along a common 
	row.&nbsp; The current family living next door keeps it well groomed though 
	as this is not their fault but likely previous owners who allowed cattle to 
	roam in the cemetery.&nbsp;
