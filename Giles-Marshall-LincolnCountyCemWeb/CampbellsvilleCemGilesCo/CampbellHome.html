This is a photo of a very old abandoned home (Private Property Please), out on
the hill, 1/2 mile east, on Lock Road in Campbellsville that is not as well kept
as it was at one time. The twin chimneys speaks of its age indicating it goes
back into the 1800s. No doubt it was an important part of the history of
Campbellsville Tennessee at one time and several families over the years took
pride in living here. Its metal roof will allow it still many more years, if
that is maintained. If you know its history let me know and we will make that
available to the public while this treasure is still standing.<b><br>
