		Gabriel Worley was born in North Carolina in 1786 and died in Giles 
		County in 1860. He became a wealthy farmer, leaving an estate worth 
		$67,064.67. (comparable to about 7 Million today 2013) His will lists 13 
		children, as well as other heirs. This will, which he wrote in 1855, is 
		on file at the Giles County Old Records Department, on the third floor
