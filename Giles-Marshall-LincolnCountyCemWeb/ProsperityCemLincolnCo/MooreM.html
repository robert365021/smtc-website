The Death Angel has again been in our midst, and took away on Tuesday, Nov. 
1, Mrs. Margaret Moore, widow of the late Robert Moore, who preceded her to the 
grave nearly two years ago. She lacked only three days of being 85 years of age, 
therefore old age was the principal cause of her death. Only a short time ago 
she had gone to live with her son, William, but God in his wisdom saw fit to call 
her to another and better home, as we believe, where she will be free from 
sickness and pain, and where she will need the hand of children, grandchildren 
and others to minister to her needs. For many years she was a constant member 
of the Prosperity church, where the remains were laid to rest on Wednesday 
afternoon after funeral services by Rev. I. N. Kennedy.)<br>
