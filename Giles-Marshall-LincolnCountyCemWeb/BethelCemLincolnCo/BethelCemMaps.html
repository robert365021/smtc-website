Fayetteville is the nearest Town about 5 miles northeast from here.&nbsp; <br>

</b>

  <b>Location: Take Highway 64 out of 
Fayetteville and go several miles and turn south (left) on Old Bethel Road. Go 
about 1 and 1/2 miles and the cemetery is on your right just before you reach 
Gunter Hollow Road.</b><img border="0" src="BethelCemAerial.jpg" width="1011" height="451"><b><br>
  This Aerial Map shows the plot where the cemetery resides next Old Bethel Road 
indicated with a yellow pointer. Most of the cemetery is in the clearing but 
parts are in the tree line west and south of the clearing. This is a very old 
and fragile cemetery with stones easily damaged by overzealous people so be 
gentle on these soft monuments if you have business here. <br>
