  From the above map we are given the GPS location of the Crawford

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville go northeast on 
Hwy 431 several miles to Howell and turn left on Shields Rd and when that forks 
turn left on Brown Teal Rd. Follow that for about a mile and and turn left 
(south) on March Mill Rd. After a few hundred yards the cemetery is on (your) 
right of the road in the thicket between two houses. Go in here with heavy boots 
on in the summer to avoid snakes and chiggers. The cemetery is right on the road 
so I don't know who owns the surrounding land since a right of way is not 
necessary.<br>
