Location: From 
Fayetteville go north on Hwy 231 to Chestnut Ridge and turn left on Hwy 129 
(Petersburg Chestnut Ridge Rd. Go about 2 miles and turn north (right) on 
Bledsoe Rd and go a few hundred yards and bear right passing 3 hundred Dollar Rd 
on the left and continue on about a half of a mile and the house on the left 
will belong to Mr. Gibson (2015). The Cemetery is behind his home about 70 yards 
under a partial fence. You will pass thru two gates.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
Go into the cemetery from the east side where there is no fence now. This is a 
winter time visit. I found the whole place high in weeds and the old fallen tree 
lying across the center of the cemetery and covering many graves and no doubt 
smashing many of the tombstones as you can see from the missing number I did not 
find.<br>
