<p><b>1 marker (broken) Aug 1833 (not my 
conclusion: from the book Lincoln County County Cemeteries by Tim &amp; Helen Marsh, 
abt 1978.<br/>
<br/>
</b>Mr Gibson the land owner reminded me that the fallen tree would be removed as 
soon as he could get to it. Lets hope so. I present you this cemetery as is and 
not as it should be as I don't see how anyone can live around this mess and not 
fix it, but then I am not in the land owners shoes. Also he alone does not bear 
the responsibility of clearing this cemetery. <br/>
Mr. Gibson also told the story that years ago a lady came from Texas and was 
investigating this cemetery. Soon he heard a loud shout coming from the 
graveyard as the woman  
discovered her ancestors graves in this cemetery. Now that is my kind of people. 
However, where are those people today 
to help clear the debris from this abandoned cemetery.</p>
