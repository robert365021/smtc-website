This map shows the coordinates of the Maxwell Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="MaxwellCemRd.jpg" width="1600" height="774"><br>
Go north on Hwy 31 to Pigeon Roost Road and turn right.
This road map shows the cemetery on the north side of Pigeon Roost Road.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery on what looked like a residential road. This 
map shows the road as a right of way. However the road ends at the driveway to 
the house and becomes a field afterward. The road to the cemetery 
also doubles as the road to the residence and also to the farm operation. Be 
sure you go here with deliberate upscale intentions and secure permission.<br>
