	MAXWELL, Unknown Soul, 
	Stone with name William A. Maxwell inscribed on it but 
	dates were cleared indicating it was a used stone. I believe this stone was 
	discarded but given to another member of the Maxwell family to mark an now 
	unknown grave and was the old stone for William Armstrong Maxwell before his 
	stone was upgraded. <a href="IMG_7098-.JPG">7098C</a>/<a href="IMG_7098.JPG">7098</a><br>
	There are other graves here that are 
	not marked by inscribed markers around the area of the Aaron Brown monument.
