<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">For those of 
who can find your ancestors 
(mine had already left or died) here you will see 
many of these families give you a complete genealogy of parentage wives and 
children. Some even have photos of their homes &amp; businesses or farms and you 
will notice many personal photos. There are even instances of photos of complete families.<br>
<br>
If you study the 
locations you will become familiar with the town names/streams &amp; other location 
features used in the early 1900s in Lincoln county and even back into the 1800s. 
Even though the districts are not numbered they show the boundaries in the 
mapping.<br>
<br>
Because of the rapid copying process some parts of the images are difficult to 
read and a bit distorted. For those pages download the page. Explode it to a 
larger size, and display it in your image software. It will then become readable 
to you at some resolution if you have good graphics. C.W.A. 18 Oct 2013<br>

The economic times of 1904 were good 
and business was flourishing in all the farms and businesses of Lincoln County 
and Fayetteville. With the Civil War behind them these highly productive folks 
were gaining wealth in record numbers from their efforts. Such 
prosperity promoted large solid families and thriving entrepreneurs in the most 
rural parts of 
the county. This environment offered work for all, even the very poor, as they all 
learned how to live off the land. <br>
What is remarkable is these folks lived out in the middle of nowhere and yet 
they found ways to prosper and promote the interaction which capitalism allows 
among themselves in a manner that kept the rural areas prosperous and thriving. 
Unlike today this labor intensive work supported large &amp; growing families. If 
you read this closely you will notice, among the hype, a productive intelligence 
that evens excels by today's standards. They were all obsessed with having the 
best. The farms had the best livestock and goods for the task at hand, even if 
it was just mules, chickens, cattle and hogs. In another instance druggist had 
the finest chemical mixes of the time and studied in some of the best colleges 
to determine what that was. This was not unlike Medical Doctors, Lawyers, 
Teachers &amp; other professionals, and we thought they had only country doctors 
&amp; lawyers in olden times. However the system did not exclude the very talented 
in spite of their education or lack of thereof. This is a situation that is lost 
today. We don't know anymore what real talent looks like in many professions as 
we have so many agendas today that supersede true talent. That is true for all 
races.<br>
Today these rural areas have very few people maintaining larger tracts of land 
usually with very few families around. There are many farms which have 
fallen into the hands of owners that are using the land as an investment. Most of 
the investment types live offsite and hire the land out that is today deemed 
productive to leaseholders many of which are not productive for family growth 
as the proprietary arrangements of olden times. It was that arrangement that the population 
of the United States exploded from about 
1600 to around 1940 when farm consolidation progressed as a consequence of large 
farm machinery that required less operators. This drove the small farm family 
out of business and into the cities. C. Wayne Austin 18 Oct 2013.</font></b></p>
