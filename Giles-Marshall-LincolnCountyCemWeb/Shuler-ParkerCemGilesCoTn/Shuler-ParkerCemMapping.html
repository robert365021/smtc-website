Location: Go west on Hwy 64 from Pulaski a mile or so and turn right (north) on 
Hwy 166. Travel that many miles thru Campbellsville and eventually passing the 
intersection of Hwy 245 on the right then just a little further up 166 look for 
Shuler Branch road on the left. Turn left there and go just over a mile and look 
for the driveway into the old Shuler Home back on the right (north) far off the 
road. It is private property. With permission go across the pasture on the left up the slope toward the 
clump of Cedar &amp; other trees in the distance and the cemetery is inside that 
clump behind a barb wire fence. Seen as Parker Cemetery in the above map. <br>
