Peter Shuler, Jr., later known as &quot;Squire Shuler&quot;, along with his father, Peter 
Shuler, Sr. and
his grandfather, Abraham Shuler moved from Rowan County, North Carolina in the 
late<br>
1820's and settled in a remote section of the 14th district of Giles County at a 
place known
as Shuler Hollow, on Shuler Branch, near Campbellsville.<br>
<br>
The house which stands in Shuler Hollow today was built for Peter Shuler, Jr., 
and his
15 year old bride, Martha Mildred Rushing. Peter and Martha were married on 
August<br>
26, 1830. Shortly thereafter, a log cabin was built for the couple and upon 
completion
of the house the young Mrs. Shuler carved her name on a log in the upstairs of 
the<br>
cabin.<br>
<br>
By 1860, the Shulers were the parents of nine children: William M., Martha E., 
Jimmia
A., Rebecca Ann Jane, Mary L., Lucy C., John Peter, Nancy, and Emma. Life was 
safe<br>
and secure in Shuler Hollow until the start of the War Between the States on 
April 12,
1861. News of the war spread like wild fire through the mountains. Little did 
people<br>
know, at the time, that the War Between the States would be one of the greatest
conflicts the world had ever known.<br>
<br>
Peter Shuler, Jr., was 53 years old, a man of courage and dedication. His son, 
William,
was 27 years old and anxious to defend the South. He enlisted in D Company, 3rd<br>
Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. This regiment was organized at Lynnville, TN on 
May
16, 1861.<br>
<br>
Days passed into weeks and weeks into months, with families waiting anxiously 
for
news of loved ones, but when news finally came to the Shuler home, it was sad 
news.<br>
Their son, William, had been killed during the Battle of Fort Donelson on 
February 15,
1862. He was buried under a large oak tree, never to return to his family in 
Shuler<br>
Hollow.<br>
<br>
Sometime after June 1862, Squire Shuler was approached about using his home as a
scout headquarters, as it was located in a remote and secluded area. One can 
only<br>
speculate as to Squire Shuler's reasons for volunteering his home for such risky
business, willingly exposing his family to the consequences of harboring spies.<br>
Perhaps the death of his son earlier that year had a bearing on the Squire's 
decision.
The only certainty is that the house in Shuler Hollow became a focal point for<br>
Southern espionage activities until November 1863, when Henry B. Shaw, alias E.
Coleman, Captain of Coleman Scouts and Sam Davis were captured within days of 
one<br>
another.<br>
<br>
The Shulers involvement with Coleman's Scouts began shortly after General 
Cheatham
appointed Henry B. Shaw as Commander of the Confederate Scouts- Bragg's Scouts.<br>
Captain Shaw was an ideal leader, often traveling in the guise of an itinerant 
herb
doctor called E. Coleman (this disguise was later to save his life). His scouts 
were<br>
carefully selected for their particular talents and became known as Coleman's 
Scouts,
operating within and behind enemy lines.<br>
<br>
Sam Davis was one of Coleman's Scouts, selected early in the organization of the 
unit.
He was the son of Charles Davis and his second wife, Jane Simmons, of Rutherford<br>
County, Tennessee. Sam Davis left home in the fall of 1860 to attend Nashville 
Military
College in Nashville, Tennessee. Shortly after the war began, he was recruited 
by<br>
Captain Shaw for the dangerous job of scouting.<br>
<br>
In 1863, Captain Shaw and his scouts were so efficient that General Dodge of the
Union Army stationed at Pulaski, sent spies of his own to penetrate Shaw's<br>
organization. General Dodge's luck turned when Sam Davis was captured on the 
20th
day of November 1863, at Minor Hill, in Giles County, TN, while traveling on the<br>
Lambs Ferry Road.<br>
<br>
Davis was scouting the enemy lines and needed to return to the Confederate
command. He had spent the night at Shuler Hollow, according to Joel Clyde 
Shuler,<br>
the grandson of Squire Shuler.<br>
<br>
According to family tradition, Sam Davis was at the Shuler house when Federal
soldiers came looking for him. He was alerted troops were approaching, and the<br>
women went out on the front porch to greet the troops, while the boys went for 
the
Davis horse hidden in the woods. The horse was brought to the barn, and Sam 
Davis<br>
left the house wearing a bonnet, dress and carrying a milk bucket, entered the 
barn
where he mounted his horse and rode out of Shuler Hollow.<br>
<br>
Several days later, while trying to return to the Confederate lines, Sam Davis 
heard
that a Confederate captain also behind Federal lines, was leaving the Pulaski 
area<br>
enroute to Decatur, Alabama. Davis found the captain and assuming he was the man
he was looking for, began to travel with him.<br>
<br>
The Captain was L.H. Naron, &quot;Captain Chickasaw&quot;, head of the Federal spies. He 
was
traveling in disguise as a Confederate captain, while searching for Confederate<br>
prisoners who had escaped from the Pulaski jail. Captain Chickasaw became aware 
of
Davis situation and led him to Federal scouts lying hidden by the Lamb's Ferry 
Road.<br>
<br>
When the travelers were within easy pistol range, the detail rose from their
concealment, weapons leveled on the two men. The officer in charge of the detail<br>
ordered the men to dismount. The men were searched, no weapons were found on
Davis. Davis had over his shoulder a hank of cotton yarn, and in a cloth 
haversack, a<br>
ball of cotton yarn the size of a man's double-fist. The hank and ball were 
thrown to
the road side. Davis was searched further, the scouts found in his pocket a 
paper with<br>
the names of the Commands and the officers attached which were in Pulaski under
General Dodge. Ordered to remount, the two were escorted that evening to 
Pulaski.<br>
<br>
Captain Chickasaw and two other were ordered to return to the site of Davis' 
capture
to retrieve the hank and ball of cotton yarn. In Pulaski, the ball of yarn was 
found to<br>
contain papers showing the disposition of troops. Was the ball of yarn provided 
by the
Shuler household to secret the information past enemy lines? Sam Davis was 
joined in<br>
the Pulaski Jail by two other fellow scouts, Moore and Davis. On the 22nd of
November, Federal troops once again descended on the Shuler home and arrested<br>
Captain Shaw in his guise as a doctor. Shaw was described as a seedy, tired and
awkward looking man, dressed in citizen's clothing. He addressed himself as 
Doctor<br>
Shaw, an ex-surgeon in the Rebel Army. He was arrested and taken to Pulaski to 
join
Davis and the other scouts in jail.<br>
<br>
Since no papers of importance were found on Shaw he was not charged with being a
spy. However, he remained a prisoner of the Federal Army and was later sent to<br>
Johnson Island on Lake Erie not far from Sandusky, Ohio. Shaw remained a 
prisoner
until after the end of the war and Coleman's Scouts were finished.<br>
<br>
Based on papers found on Davis, in his saddle seat and in his boot, he was tried 
and
convicted of being a Confederate Spy and was hung on East Hill, on Friday 
morning,<br>
the 27th of November 1863. After the end of the war, Henry B. Shaw returned to 
the
home of John G. Davis, friend, fellow scout and half brother of Sam Davis. He 
stayed<br>
until the fall of 1866, when he persuaded John G. Davis and his father, Charles 
Davis,
to purchase a steamboat. The steamboat &quot;David White&quot; was valued at $50,000.<br>
<br>
On the 27th of February 1866, the &quot;David White&quot; exploded while traveling on the
Mississippi River, below Helena, Arkansas. Here on the &quot;David White&quot;, Captain 
Henry<br>
B. Shaw and fellow scout John G. Davis lost their lives.<br>
<br>
Years later, with the death of Squire Peter Shuler on October 21, 1894, an 
adventure
ended, one which began in the 1820's when Abraham Shuler, Peter Shuler, Sr., and 
his<br>
young son left Rowan County, NC to seek their fortunes in Giles County and
established a homestead in Shuler Hollow.<br>
<br>
The Shuler family cemetery still exists, overgrown, the tombstones 
weather-beaten,
cracked, broken, but legible. Several older grave markers are heavy field rocks 
placed<br>
to mark the resting places of Abraham and Peter Shuler, Sr., the patriarchs of 
the
Tennessee Shulers.<br>
<br>
The Shuler house still stands with the memories and secrets of times past hidden
deep within its walls, some of the most patriotic men in Confederate history had<br>
passed through the doors of the Shuler home. The house has been added on,
modified, but major features remain unaltered. The two-story front building and 
angle-<br>
story back room once separated by an open &quot;dogtrot&quot; are now joined.&nbsp;
Curiously, the existence of an attic that was unknown to family members but was<br>
explored only after it was discovered that entrance to the attic could be gained
through a closet in the backroom. A wall inside the closet swung back to reveal 
a<br>
steep dark staircase that led to a low-ceiling room under the eaves. Was this 
the
sleeping area for the scouts, secluded away from the family quarters, accessible 
only<br>
through a hidden entrance? No one knows and if they did they have forgotten.</font></b></p>
