HARRY FORSYTHE, interred in this cemetery under the name 

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS; ">
Robert Harrison Forsyth. He died 26 May 1909, age 66 Years 6 Months. He was a C.S.A. 
veteran and as you can see from the above photo dressed the part. His wife was 
Julia Simpson Forsythe lies beside him. <br>
<br>
This is about the folks that were identified in the above 
photo except one Mr. Pinckney Johnston which I was uncertain of the identity in 
the above photo, though he was in the photo not shown here that was also not so 
clear but clear enough to identify the above individuals. For Pinckney Johnson I 
have not identified his grave location. <br>
Many of the ladies above were the wives of these folks and while I can tell from 
the grave listings who they were I cannot tie that to their faces above, but it 
is obvious from their dress they were prominent ladies. I do not think the photo 
above were of the whole congregation, but made from the leadership and their 
families of this church. </span><font color="#800000"><br>
