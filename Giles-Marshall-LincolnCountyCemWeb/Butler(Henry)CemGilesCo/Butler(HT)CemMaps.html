This road map which shows only the old Hwy 64 is slightly incorrect but the 
cemetery is still off of Bubb Road. Directions: Go east from Pulaski By pass on 
New Hwy 64 to Aymett Town Road and go thru Aymett Town and pass Leatherwood 
Creek Road on your left and bear right into Bubb Rd. The cemetery is in the 
right corner of the driveway of the first residential road on your right after 
you bear right into Bubb Road. It was behind a tall fence with no gate when I 
was there forcing you to go all the way into the farm and double back. There is 
no gate and an electric fence awaiting you. Well just another obstacle for an 
old country boy who could clear 6 foot fence at one time without touching it. 
Now I do good to clear a 6 inch fence.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery in the corner of Bubb &amp; a residential road. It is fenced with electrical 
shock protection on two sides and a high wire fence on the other two sides.<br>
