This stone should have been cleaned better because I cannot now 
read the Month of death on Henry T. Butler. It is covered by dry mud. Also the exact year of death as the &quot;0&quot; in 
1870 is pretty much presumed though I can see it is a curved numeral. The 
tombstone readers of years ago read the death date as 29 May 1870. The Stone 
Carvers were Morris Brothers as inscribed. This stone is sadly broken and though 
the grounds are&nbsp; fence it is neglected. This is a perfect example of a 
graveyard that should be moved to a bigger nearby graveyard where maintenance 
can occur.<br>
I went to visit this graveyard in 2011 during the summer and due to the high 
fence situation and high weeds I saw no visible stones. Went back in Nov 2012 
when the weeds were gone I found visit there was at one formal tombstone here.
