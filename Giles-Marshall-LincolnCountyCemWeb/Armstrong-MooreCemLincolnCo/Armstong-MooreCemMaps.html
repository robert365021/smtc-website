Location: From 
Fayetteville go north on Highway 231 about 6 miles and the highway will bend to the 
left to go around a steep hill ahead. Just after that look for house at the bottom 
of the hill and the cemetery is behind that home in a grove of trees at the top 
of the hill. The old 
Stage Coach road went thru the cemetery and did not go around the hill. You will 
find graves on both sides of the ruts that were made by the carriages cutting 
into the ground.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
The Whitaker Cemetery is highlighted here but look just north of there about a 
mile for the Moore Cemetery.<br>
