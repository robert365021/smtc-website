<font size="2" color="#800000">Due to the recent growth of brush&nbsp; and the amount of time I 
was here I 
was unable to do a complete survey of this cemetery. There were numerous graves on 
the east side of the road bed which I omitted. In the interest of getting 
a good index I present this cemetery but defer the presentation to 
Findagrave.com to Jim Steelman 
&amp; Wayne Owens. Many of the flat ones I am sure were covered in leaf matter. They spent a lot of time on this cemetery 
looking for all the monuments and even doing 
restoration work. This was a tough cemetery to survey due to the scattered stones and 
graves lightly marked with small concrete monuments and other means of low 
budget monuments.</font></p>
