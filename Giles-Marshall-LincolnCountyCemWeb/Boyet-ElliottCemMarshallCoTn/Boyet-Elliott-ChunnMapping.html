  From the above map we are given the GPS location of the Boyet-Elliott-Chunn Cemetery of 
		Lewisburg, Marshall County, Tennessee. My GPS marker is between the 
		Boyet markers in the north area and the Elliott markers in the south 
		section.<br>

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From the Lewisburg Square go out 
		west Commerce St and take Hwy 373 (Mooresville Hwy). When you start 
		bending to the left on the highway you will see the water tank upon a 
		hill on your left. From there look for a new blacktop road and turn left 
		into that. Careful here the visibility into oncoming traffic is not 
		good. The cemetery road will wind its way up the hill top where the 
		cemetery is located.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery more clearly located under the tree line 
		sandwiched in by residential property and Joyce Ave. The above yellow 
		lines are rough areas approximating the cemetery and bear no legal 
		resemblance to the property lines of these two cemeteries. Visit these 
		cemeteries from the south side without disturbing the neighbors. However 
		you may get a curious visit if you go here from a neighbor who tends to 
		watch over these graves. The City of Lewisburg maintains the grounds of 
		this cemetery.</font></b><i><font size="2"><b><br>
