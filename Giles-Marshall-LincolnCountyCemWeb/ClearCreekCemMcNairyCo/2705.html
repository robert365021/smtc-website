It is known there was an early Christian Church here which spawned this
cemetery. It probably had some connection to the Campbell Station, Maury County Tennessee
Christian Church related to the early families who removed to here. Later in the
1890s there was a name change to Church of Christ but the beliefs remained the
same.
This name change was related to this church and others separating themselves from
their liberal northern congregations.<i><br>
