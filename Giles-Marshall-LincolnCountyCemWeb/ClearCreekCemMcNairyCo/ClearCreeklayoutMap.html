<font size="2" color="#000080"><b>The front side is near the entrance to the
road and the back side appears further across than across the front side. Area 1
includes a large tree and is the newer section. Area 2 is also new, but gets
quickly back
into the stones of the early 1900s. Area 3 has the oldest stones with death
dates into the 1860s. Area 4 has a large cedar &amp; pine tree thicket on its
left edge and
has some damage to the stones due to fallen trees breaking up the stones. There
is one ornamental iron fence (the Kerr plots) with one stone with two inscriptions. There may be
other graves in that fence but not many. The size would not justify that.</b></font><i><a href="../BrickChurchCemGilesCo/BrickChurchCemList.html"><b><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>
