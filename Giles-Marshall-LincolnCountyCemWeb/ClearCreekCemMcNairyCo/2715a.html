<b><font size="2" color="#008000">McAfee, Moses, 1776 - May 7, 1846 (unmarked
&amp; lost grave)<br>
</font><font size="2" color="#000080"><i>I have drawn arrows that might show the
locations of this lost grave(s) in the back of the cemetery. These are
approximate and are an attempt to set a range if someone were approaching the
grave site. These arrows were drawn up from Autry's statements below. The Cedar
Tree line he speaks of is just inside the right side of this photo and extending
back right off of the photo. Also the location is over the crest of the hill and
mostly out of our view. I did not have photos for the exact places he mentioned
since there are few stones back there. [Wayne Austin, 21 Oct 2009]&nbsp;<br>
</i></font><font size="2"><i>The dates of birth for: Moses McAfee birth 1776
died May 7, 1846, Stantonville, McNairy County, Tennessee, USA, his place of
birth is unknown although his two wives (sisters) were supposedly from GA. To
find this unmarked grave one would stand about 15 ft. to the left of the cedar
tree line and walk straight to the back of the cemetery (first row of graves in
the back), this would be approximate vicinity for the grave of Moses. I only
wish I had paid more attention when the exact spot was shown to me as a young
boy, by my three uncle McAfee's, Taylor, Egbert, and Charlie.<br>
[Autrey McAfee, (a descendent) 20 Oct 2009]<br>
<font color="#800080">Wayne, I�m including Autry�s note back to me. It is
good to know that we can show he is buried at Clear Creek even if we don't know
the exact grave site. One day that information could be useful to someone
besides us. I should have asked Autry if Moses' wives were also buried there.
Will email him back and see if he knows that. [Doris Oswalt 21 Oct 2009]</font></i></font><font size="2" color="#800080"><br>
