<b><font size="2" color="#000080">This is the only photo I have ever seen of the 
Clear Creek Christian (Church of Christ) Church. The original or at least 
another copy is in the hands of Duane Helweg. I am unaware of the founding date 
of this church but I have an ancestor named John B. Kerr &amp; his wife Priscilla 
who settled here in 1844. Other (siblings) family members followed them or came 
here about the same time from Maury County Tennessee and it is my belief they 
were all members of the Christian Church. It is clear the building was 
constructed in early times when separate doors for women and men were provided. 
That included separate benches after gaining entrance. <br>
The writing at the bottom of the photo is describing where years ago Martha Bea 
Brooks Wicker went to church. This church facility was actually abolished about 
in the 1970s. I had contact with Sherry Ladd who grew up here and she among 
others tried to prevent its demolition but was unable to prevent that. C. Wayne

I (Doris Oswalt) am including Duaneï¿½s book signature. He has actually been to 
the historic Shiloh Methodist Church for a book signing of his book about Shiloh 
as noted here:<br>
