<i>
It is likely that John B. Kerr is interred here or somewhere near here. He died
50 years earlier than his brother and sister-in-law and we know from the Clear
Creek Church Minutes that when he died he was a member of this church.&nbsp; His Wife
Priscilla Warden (sister of Mary Ann also interred here) and son Joseph J. Kerr
were dismissed in 1847 to move back to their home station of Campbell Station,
Maury County Tennessee. Family information passed down says she sold the land
for over $1,800 dollars and rode on horse back to her old home in Maury County.
She wanted to educate her son in the schools there.</i><br>
