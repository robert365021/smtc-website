Notice in this next exploded photo in 2013 
there are remnants of something that appears to be standing tombstones, but this 
may be confused as a part of old fence post. Being very blurred it is not clear. 
This is near the lot line between the cemetery and private property nearby:<a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/HopsonCemPulaskiGilesCo/GooglePic2013-1.jpg">9646</a></b><br/>

<b>HOPSON, Mason, (b. cir 1775) 
- 04 Jan 1873, Aged 98 years <br/>
HOPSON, Younger, 02 Sep 1768 - 20 Dec 1844<br/>

This cemetery seems to 
occupy a whole town lot. I ask a person next door who had some connections. He 
said he did not know of any complete tombstones in this cemetery, but directed 
me to the base of a large tree where there was found one fragment of a carved 
stone. No inscriptions were found on it. <br/>
1987:Grave markers were found in poor condition in the survey for the Giles Co 
Cemetery book. <br/>
20 Apr 2017: No tombstones found in this cemetery today (20 Apr 2017). The 
cemetery has been completely destroyed. No fragment of any inscriptions was 
located by this visitor. Why is it that old cemeteries near population centers 
are always in the most poor condition. The cemeteries faring well are always 
those near a caretaker far out in the rural areas. This amounts to further 
evidence that (young teens bent on destruction) vandals are doing most of the 
damage to old cemeteries.</b></p>
