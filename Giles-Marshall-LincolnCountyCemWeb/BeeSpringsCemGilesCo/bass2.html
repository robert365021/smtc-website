WILLIAM LEWIS BASS<br>
<br>
Again our community has been saddened by a visit from the death angel who 
entered the home of Mr. and Mrs. George Bass and bore the spirit of their son 
William away on his cold, icy wings. He had been sick for several months, and 
though his death was daily expected, it was a great shock to his beloved ones. 
But they do not grieve as those who have no hope, for he declared his 
willingness to die, and told of his bright hope of Heaven. He leaves a wife and 
two little boys. May He who has promised to be a husband to the widow and father 
to the fatherless, comfort and sustain them in their dark hour. Funeral services 
were conducted by Rev. J. F. Beasley at Bee Springs Church and burial in the 
beautiful cemetery adjoining.<br>
