John Henry Bass, 83, service station operator in the Bunker Hill community, was 
found dead Tuesday morning, March 11, at his home. It is suspected that he died

a number of years. A member of his family visited him Monday night, taking him 
some food for his supper.<br>
Funeral rites were held at 2 o&#39;clock Wednesday afternoon at the Bunker Hill 
Methodist Church, conducted by the Rev. Carl Holloway, pastor of the church. 
Burial took place in Bee Springs Cemetery.<br>
Born in Giles County on March 13, 1868, he was the son of the late George Bass 
and Ann Holbert Bass. He had been a member of the Methodist Church since his 
youth.<br>
Mr. Bass never married.<br>
The survivors include two sister, Mrs. Mollie Stevenson, Bodenham, and Mrs. 
Sidney Mitchell, Bunker Hill; and two brothers, Clyde Bass, Flintville, and O. 
B. Bass, Bunker Hill.<br>
