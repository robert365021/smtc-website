  <b>Location: Take Highway 64 east out of 
Pulaski and take Interstate 65 South to Bryson Road Exit (6) Go east up Bryson 
Road and turn north on Bunker Hill Road. After about 3/4 a mile turn back right 
or east on Bee Springs Road. Travel Bee Springs Road about 2 miles and see the 
church building on the right and the cemetery on the left behind a rock wall. </b>

  This Aerial Map shows the plot where the cemetery resides next the Bee Springs 
Road. The Church &amp; spring are on the right. This is a very old 
cemetery and contains many fragile stones easily damaged by overzealous people, so be 
gentle on these soft monuments if you have business here. Touch them only if you 
have experience with old monuments.&nbsp; <br>
