  STEVENSON, Coleman L., 26 Dec 1832 - 24 Oct 1908. Full of good works and deeds 
of charity we feel a great man &amp; prinse in Isreal hath fallen among us.<br>
<br>
STEVENSON, Coleman Lafayette The Pulaski Citizen 12 Nov 1908 &quot;Memorial&quot;<br>
The following caper was read at the Memorial service of the Bee Spring Sunday 
School, held in memory of the late C. L. Stevenson last Sunday morning.<br>
It is with sad hearts that we pause today in our regular Sabbath School work and 
pay a tribute to one who has long stood in our ranks.<br>
C. L. Stevenson was born Dec. 26, 1832, and on the morning of Oct. 24, 1908 his 
spirit entered through the portals of eternal life.<br>
He had spent almost four score years in the ever changing scenes of life&#39;s 
battles and his death was like the laying down of arms, when the soldier hero 
retires from the fields of victory glory crowned.<br>
He has always been a citizen of Giles County and though Giles is largely 
populated with men of sterling worth we know that C. L. Stevenson ranked with 
her best.<br>
He was married 3 times, first to Miss Louisa Jackson who died early after the 
marriage. She was the mother of his son W. B. Stevenson.<br>
His second marriage was to Miss Dorcas Jackson. The remained in wedlock for a 
period of many years, when death took her from him. She was the mother of his 
three sons, J. M., E. A. and T. M. Stevenson.<br>
His last marriage was to Mrs. William Tungett, who survives him.<br>
Besides these four sons he has reared no less than twelve orphans, and for a 
period of forty years he has had an orphan under his fatherly care and at time 
there has been as many as four in his home at the same time. In God&#39;s word we 
read: &quot;Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit 
the father less and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted 
from the world.&quot;<br>
For a period of sixty four years he has been a member of the Methodist Church, 
and for fifty years a steward in the church.<br>
He came of an honorable family. A noble lineage was his and in the very 
beginning of life, there was the foundation where on to build a character which 
was strong like Gibraltar&#39;s rock. A character that stood the test of time, a 
character clean, pure and ideal.<br>
He did not have the advantage which some men have of an extended scholastic 
education, and yet his education died comprise those essentials which make a man 
or woman fitted for life.<br>
It disciplined his feelings, it inspired true and worthy motives. It inspired a 
profound religious feeling. It inculcated pure morality and purity of life, and 
these embrace, the large term of education.<br>
Every one knows him to be kind and true. All appreciate him and honored him. He 
was looked to for aid and depended upon him when help was needed. He was truly a 
man of great usefulness.<br>
As an agriculturist he was well skilled and the result was, prosperity awaited 
his labors. But be it said to his credit, that liberality in the furtherance of 
every good when it required means, was a true characteristic of him.<br>
Whereas, it has pleased God to remove from us our beloved co-worker in Sunday, 
C. L. Stevenson.<br>
Therefore be it Resolved, That while we know that we have sustained a loss 
severe indeed, yet we are consoled by the thought, that as a school we have been 
wonderfully blessed by having his noble character before us as open book so long 
a time. 2nd, That we believe that the influence for good arising from his 
honorable life, will not cease to live, but will continue to widen out as the 
wave set in motion spreads over the bosom of the lake. 3rd, That as a Sunday 
School we extend the sorrowing ones our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.<br>
