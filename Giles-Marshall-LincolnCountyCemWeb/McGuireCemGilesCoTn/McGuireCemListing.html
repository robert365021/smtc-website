<b>Just as I was stepping of the truck to survey this cemetery 
there came a fierce thunderstorm and it poured rain with the accompanying 
lightning &amp; thunder. I waited about 5 minutes and decided to use the umbrella 
and get the one photo of an inscription best I could. I had been shown the 
marker earlier by Mr. Story. I had a very hard time getting past the thorns and 
brush to photograph the inscription in a way that it could be read in the storm. The tombstone had 
been toppled for years and I could not see but one side or maybe two sides so I 
am uncertain if there were other inscriptions on the stone. A job for another 
day. That is to move the parts around to check for missed inscription and 
recheck other parts of the cemetery. This cemetery has never been reported by 
anyone in the past.</b></p>
