MARS HILL CEMETERY, LYNNVILLE (129) RD, MARSHALL COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

</b><center><b>Standing just south of the
last photo this is the back (north) side of the cemetery looking northwest at
the massive but somewhat broken monuments of the Black, Davis, Kincaid and other
families who occupied this area in the early to mid 1800s. Someone at one time
spent a significant part of their life savings to have these monument erected
and we allow them to be trashed like this. We should be ashamed. This is just as
much a cemetery as the nice nearby city cemetery.<br>
