Samuel Alexander Esselman, May 14, 1839, Mar 21, 1840. The stone is in danger of
being swallowed up by the Hackberry tree. It will probably just keep
growing around the stone until the stone is no longer visible. In danger of crushing the stone
when it falls. It may move the stone causing it
to fall. Urgent attention needed to save this stone. The tree should first be cut
above the stone causing it to fall away from the stone. Require care and
understanding of a lot of physics of weight, proportion &amp; lumberjack skills to cause all this to
happen. The gruesome truth is this tree has penetrated the grave and is feeding
on the remains of the deceased. We the public should do better than allow this. <i><br>
