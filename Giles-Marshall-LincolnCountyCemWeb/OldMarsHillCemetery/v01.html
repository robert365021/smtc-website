MARS HILL CEMETERY, LYNNVILLE (129) RD, MARSHALL COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

We are looking west from the southern central area of the cemetery at the many
broken and other stones with missing inscriptions. The road is on our left. The
tall stones further back are for the Brown &amp; Massey families.&nbsp;<br>

Looking north from the western edge notice the many fieldstones scattered about marking graves. Bear in mind Marked
graves only came into being after about 1818 time frame. I am unaware where the
old Mars Hill Meeting House stood here. Most of us have ideas about our
ancestors that they had resources to purchase massive monuments to their life.
Not so in most cases prior to 1820 here in Tennessee.<br>
