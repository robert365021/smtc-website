Fieldstones more fieldstones. To me this indicates one of three things. (1)
These people were just poor or did not believe in marked graves or (2) Mars Hill
Church Community was founded well before 1820 and many died before that or (3)
maybe these were the slave graves who usually did not have marked graves. bue
they appear to be among marked stones scattered through the cemetery. None of
the records indicate the burial of slaves here.&nbsp;</font></b><center><b><font size="2" color="#800000"><br>
