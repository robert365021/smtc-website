</font><font size="2" color="#008000">From Shelbyville go out West Lane St which 
becomes either Fishing Ford Pike or Warner Bridge Road. Follow that as it winds 
northwest toward the Duck River for about 3 miles. After passing the junction of Troupe Rd 
and&nbsp; Fishing Ford Pike aka Warner Bridge Road go about a half of a mile and 
look right at a pond on the right. With permission, turn right into the private drive and 
go up the hill 200 yards to the top and the cemetery is on the left (30 feet) in 
a small round tree thicket as shown on these maps below. The cemetery in the 
past has been reported in bad shape, but may have been cleared some since, but 
the stones are probably not being maintained.<br>

&nbsp;This aerial view shows the various assets needed to get to this cemetery. 
From the maps this appears to be exclusive &amp; highly private land so account for 
that in your visit with permission as it may have gated locks.<br>

</i>This view from MS Bing - Birds Eye view shows the faint view of the few trees 
under (marked with a red check) which the cemetery resides. This entrance is private and may be gated. I 
am unaware of the owner's name at this time.<br>
