The Hiram Brewer family lived for a time in the home shown on this site as the 
original log cabin. It was said by G.C. Brewer in his autobiography to be on the 
Giles County side of the line. Later they moved to Wayland Springs to operate a 
resort there in Lawrence County Tennessee and then next they crossed the 
Tennessee River to live in Lawrence County Alabama to Red Bank just south of 
where the Wheeler Dam is located today. Next they moved on to Florence, Alabama 
where this photo was taken where they (parents) remained until their deaths and 
are buried in the Florence City Cemetery. Many of these sons would grow up to be 
successful ministers of the Gospel because of the positive influence of 
Virginia's mother and the parents of this family. All of these sons were 
important in establishing schools all over the country to teach the gospel as 
they were very prominent preachers of their time.<br>
