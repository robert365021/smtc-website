<b><font face="Courier New">The three parties investigating this are C. Wayne 
Austin, Trish &amp; Nick Boone and Richard Wells. Richard knows of several unmarked 
graveyards around this area of the county which have been investigated. One of 
those is also across the hill north of here behind the old Maxey home where fieldstones mark 
several graves, so that is another 
possible site. We were told by the property owners here that this site was a 
graveyard, but that no one knew who was buried here except it was known to be a 
man and a woman years ago, since this is an unknown graveyard. 
Also this site lies across the Lawrence County/Giles County, but on the Giles County 
side. This is most likely to be the place of the Maxey Cemetery. Though these 
were prominent people we think they did not 
mark the graves because of a culture that was found among old settlers 
regarding the vanity of photos and gravestones (sinful graven images they were 
called.)<br>
It is not absolutely proven that this is the grave site of Isaiah &amp; Eliza 
(Warden) Maxey. This property was part of the Maxey Farm. 
It later fell into the hands of an African-American family. Then back to a 
Church of Christ Preacher and his wife. Other possible sites of the graves are 
Yarbrough Cemetery due north of here on Weakley Creek Road just inside the 
Lawrence County Line. Greenwood Cemetery where an early Christian Church was 
thriving or perhaps the Black Cemetery in Lawrence County near where the Maxey's 
had their first home. Major evidence also exist that the actual homes of the Maxey &amp; 
Brewer families lay on the north side of Gimlet Creek whereas this site is on 
the south side.<br>
I must add here the Trish has been dogmatically tracking every lead about this 
possible grave site and confirms in her own mind after talking with other 
distant cousins that indeed this is the graveyard of Isaiah Thomas Maxey and 
some members of his family. Which ones, it is not so clear.</font></b></p>

					Photographed this grave site on a late afternoon 22 Nov 2010. Added here 
					28 Jul 2012. The gravesites of the Maxey's have eluded Trish 
					Boone for years, Trish is a descendent of these folks. Major source above 
					is a book by her uncle a prominent Gospel Preacher G. C. Brewer, but 
					G.C. did not mention their grave location. Wayne &amp; others has 
					investigated all the graves for miles around at least the 
					known marked ones, including the very large Mt Moriah 
					Cemetery, so he is aware that they do not have 
					marked graves nearby here unless the stones have fallen and 
					lost.</font></i></p>
