<br>
Birth: 1815 -&nbsp; Jul. 15, 1886, Giles County Tennessee <br>
<br>
Autobiography of G. C. Brewer pages 12 - 17 &amp; 19.<br>
Isaiah T. Maxey was married to a Miss Jane Higdon and to them were born several 
children, four of whom seemed to live to be adult men and women. The sons were 
James, John and Thomas. The daughter that lived to be a woman was named Mary.
<br>
John and Thomas Maxey were lost in the Civil War. They either died in prison or 
were killed. However, Thomas, at least, left a wife and children and we shall 
see a connection that again is formed in this family later on. </font>

<font size="2" color="#CC3300">**<font size="2" color="#000080">James Radford 
Maxey went to California in <br>
1849. (Gold Rush) He escaped the Civil War because California was not then one 
of the states of the United States. He never returned and he and my mother 
(Virginia Maxey) were the last two members of the family left ,and they used to 
correspond. However, they never saw each<br>
other and James Radford Maxey was lost in a flash flood in about the year 1892 
or 1893.<br>
<br>
Some years after the death of his first wife, Isaiah T. Maxey married a Miss 
Eliza Warden and of this union was born Virginia Maxey who later became Virginia 
Maxey Brewer and the mother of all Hiram Brewer's children.<br>
<br>
ELIZA WARDEN MAXEY was born and reared in Maury County, Tennessee, not far from 
Lynnville. (Campbell Station) Her parents (Warden surname), however, came by 
covered wagon from Pennsylvania into Tennessee. Their parents had brought them 
to this country from Scotland. My grandmother tells the story of how they came 
across the mountains in their wagons and how they had to preserve fire from one 
encampment to another. This fire was placed in an iron pot and tied under the 
wagon so that they would have fire for their cooking at the<br>
next encampment. She said when they reached Tennessee they cleared out the 
canebrakes and cut away the forests and established a home. The first year, 
however, after they had come to Tennessee she was told there was a tremendous 
earthquake which shook down the trees and wrapped the cane in a vast 
entanglement and did other damage to their properties. This was the earthquake 
that formed Reelfoot Lake and I believe it occurred in the year 1812. Eliza 
Warden was born in 1813.<br>
While it is reported that they came from Scotland, they must have either had 
some of the blood of the Dutch in them or else they partook of the habits of the 
Dutch people with whom they had formerly been living. My grandmother was a very 
industrious woman, a tireless worker and an immaculate housekeeper and one who 
seemed to be capable of doing any type of work that the household needed. She 
picked the seed out of the cotton, carded the cotton, spun it into thread and 
wove the thread into cloth. Likewise, she took the wool cut from the sheep's 
back and carded it and spun it and wove it and made great varieties of woolen 
blankets, woolen cloth which later was cut and made into suits, both for men and 
for women. She also made buttons.<br>
She made these out of flax thread, wrapped tightly around the cane until it made 
the desired form and she whipped this thread together with a needle until the 
cane was removed and kept whipping it until the hole in the center was well 
filled. She said that one set of buttons would wear out two suits of clothes.
<br>
<br>
Eliza Warden had brothers and sisters and these, with possibly one or two 
exceptions, had large families. I have met some of my cousins and second cousins 
who descended from this family, hut I never had any intimate acquaintance with 
any of them and I could not give any facts concerning them (warden's) now. The 
Wardens were members of the New Testament church and seemed to be<br>
strong in the faith. I think it is said that they read the papers that were put 
out by Alexander Campbell and possibly they had heard him preach. Eliza Warden 
Maxey remained true to the faith despite the fact that her husband was a 
Primitive Baptist preacher. There was a difference between them but so far as 
anything was reported to me, there was no conflict. My grandmother Maxey 
subscribed to the Gospel Advocate when it first began to be published and she 
continued to read it up to the time that I can remember myself. Always on Lord's 
Day mornings, whether they were going to worship or simply remain at home, my 
grandmother put things in order and dressed in her Sunday best and then sat down 
with her New Testament upon one knee and the Gospel Advocate upon the other, and 
spent the Lord's Day &quot;in the spirit.&quot; To her should go the credit for the faith 
of Virginia Maxey Brewer and her husband and their eight adult children. Eliza 
Warden Maxey has two grandsons who are preachers of the Gospel and at least 
three great grandsons who are now (1950s) preaching the Gospel. This shows what 
the strength of one's faith may do and it proves the power of mother and<br>
grandmother over their children and grandchildren. I like to pay this tribute to 
my Grandmother Maxey in addition to the point that she was strong in the faith. 
As is said above, she is the only one of my four grandparents of whom I have any 
recollection. <br>

CHAPTER II<br>
<br>
ANCESTRAL HOME AND EARLY YEARS<br>
<br>
It has been stated in the former chapter that my Grandfather Maxey owned a farm 
which lay across the Lawrence and Giles County line. It seems that he had had a 
home near Lawrenceburg when mother was born. The place in later years became 
known as the &quot;Old Black Place.&quot; This was some two miles northeast of the Court 
House at Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.<br>
Whether Grandfather lost this place in the raids that were made on him during 
the Civil War or whether he sold it before the place was destroyed I am not able 
to say. I have been told always that the soldiers seesawed back and forth across 
his place, the Blue and the Gray fighting each other and I, myself, picked up &quot;minnie 
balls&quot; on that old farm after I grew to be a big boy. I have also been told that 
either the soldiers or some raiders or &quot;bushwhackers&quot; destroyed grandfather's 
barns and<br>
buildings and that the war killed his sons, freed his slaves and devastated his 
home.<br>
At any rate, the home that I knew as our ancestral home was the one down on 
Gimlet Creek, in the &quot;hills and hollers&quot; where there were abundant springs of 
good cold water, copious timber and enough land at least to support the cattle 
and sheep and to make the bread and the meat that a family needed in those days. 
Grandfather erected the house which afterward became the Brewer Home and in 
which most of the Brewer children were born. A portion of this old house is 
still standing and the brick chimney seems to be about as good as new. However, 
at the time I was born, my mother and father were living in a<br>
tenant house on the farm and this house was across the line in the Giles County 
portion of the farm. A drawing of this house will be used as an illustration in 
this book.<br>
<br>
After the death of my grandfather, my father and mother moved into his home and 
this is the home that I remember. They took care of grandmother until her death 
which occurred some eight years after the death of my grandfather. Then the 
property all descended to Virginia Maxey Brewer and her children.<br>
<br>
This house was built of logs but it was well built and it had ample room for the 
way that people lived in those days. My grandfather and my grandmother had a 
barn, a smoke house; they had spinning wheels and looms; they had an ash hopper 
by which they obtained lye and home made soap, and some of these things were 
kept up by my father and mother after grandfather was gone. All people who have 
lived over the same years that I have lived have seen the world undergo many 
changes. But those who were not born under the old regime and who did not know 
how the people lived in the good old &quot;home spun&quot; days of the pre-Civil War 
period cannot possibly be aware of how radical some of the changes are that have 
come in the last three-quarters of a century.<br>
<br>
In our early days, my father had sheep, cows, horses and hogs. He not only sold 
wool and lambs on the market, but we<br>
had mutton at home when we wanted it. And up to the death of my grandmother, 
some of the wool was still carded and spun in our home. I distinctly remember 
going to sleep with the hum of the spinning wheel as grandmother spun the wool 
into the thread which would later be knitted into our stockings and socks and 
perhaps into such garments as coats and sweaters.<br>
Each year my father (Hiram Brewer) fattened and killed anywhere from six to ten 
hogs and put up the meat in the old ancestral smoke house. That house, as I 
remember it, always contained lard and meat and potatoes and turnips and various 
other things that would serve to supply the table for a growing family. We never 
wanted for anything while we lived in the ancestral home. It is true that we did 
not want much, but we did not know what there was in the world to want. But we 
were considered better off than many of the neighbors that lived around us. This 
was because of the old furniture that we had in our home and because of the 
well-supplied smoke house and because of the type of horses my father always 
managed to own and some of it probably was attributable to an air which my 
mother had inherited from her father and some of which perhaps from her mother. 
Even in her hardest days, Mother had the appearance and the air of an 
aristocrat.<br>
Right near our home was a school which was known as &quot;Snead's School.&quot; This 
school seemed to teach all grades from the first reader up through what would 
now be called high school work. Children of the community attended this school 
and grown young men and women came into the community to board and attend 
Snead's School. Two of my first cousins, Malachi Brewer and his brother Charles 
or Stuart Brewer who were sons of my Uncle Cal Brewer came and stayed with us 
and attended the Snead School. One of them became an expert penman and also 
became a teacher and for a good many years taught school. The other became an 
efficient surveyor and for a number of years he was the county surveyor of 
Lawrence County, Tennessee. All of this simply shows the type of school that was 
conducted at Snead's School House. This school, however, had closed its doors 
before I was old enough to attend school. The first school that I attended was 
at Champ's Branch and one of the first teachers that I recall at Champ's Branch 
was Frank Walls.<br>

CHAPTER III, Page 19<br>
<br>
WE MOVE AND MOVE AND MOVE<br>
When my grandfather, Isaiah Maxey passed away, he left a will bequeathing 
everything he had to his daughter, Virginia Maxey, my mother. He had no other 
children except James Radford Maxey who was then in California. His son Thomas 
Maxey who was lost in the Civil War had left some children but these children 
had died and not even a grandchild was living at the time of Isaiah Maxey's 
passing. However, one of Thomas' daughters had married and was the mother of 
several children before she was deceased. These were great grandchildren of 
Isaiah Maxey, but they had come from his first marriage and<br>
since a good deal of his property had come through the second wife, Eliza Warden 
Maxey, together with the fact that Virginia Maxey was to take care of him and 
her mother in their old age, the property was all willed to her. However, the 
father of these great grandchildren threatened court action to break the will 
and get some of the property for his children. In order to keep from having a 
suit in court, my father and mother agreed to compromise with the man and give 
him a portion of the estate.<br>
Instead of dividing the acreage, they put a mortgage on the farm and paid him in 
money, the portion that it took to satisfy him.<br>
This was the beginning of sorrows for Virginia Maxey Brewer and Hiram S. Brewer. 
They could not make enough money on the farm to live and to pay off this 
mortgage. Therefore, after the death of my grandmother in 1893, Hiram and 
Virginia decided to sell out completely and move away and go into business in 
some other place. They did sell the entire estate and move to Wayland Springs 
which is still in Lawrence County, Tennessee. At this time this little place was 
a summer resort and a watering place. They had a variety of mineral springs at 
the place and there was a good deal of activity, at least a portion of the year, 
in this little town. Hiram and Virginia Brewer had taken as part payment for 
their estate some valuable stock and Father therefore had a stock stable at 
Wayland Springs to which people came to purchase quality livestock etc.<br>
<br>
See page 348 Genealogy in Giles County Newspapers 1852 to 1899. (Printed in the 
news 5 Aug 1886 less 21 days equals an estimated death date of 15 Jul 1886 for 
Isaiah Thomas Maxey.) Test of Obituary condensed:<br>
<br>
SNEEDS ACADEMY. Since our last writing, death has visited our vicinity. About 3 
weeks ago Rev Isaac (Isaiah Thomas) Maxey, an aged veteran of the Christian 
Warfare was called from his terrestrial labors to a celestial home above the 
skies. He had been sick for several months. <br>
</font><i>**This was true to the best of GC 
Brewer's knowledge at the time of the writing of his book. However, Since that 
time, new information has come to light through census and marriage records. In 
1850, James Radford Maxey was still living at home with his parents in Tennessee 
and in 1860 he is found in Missouri. To date, the earliest we find him in 
California is 1863. As researched by Trish Brewer Boone a great niece of GC 
Brewer <br>
</i><i>
<br>
Trish Boone who owns all these land records, some found at the Lawrence County Archives 
two properties sold to I.T. Maxey from a Mary Burkett and a John Burkett. This 
was in 1852 eight or nine years before the civil war.<br>
