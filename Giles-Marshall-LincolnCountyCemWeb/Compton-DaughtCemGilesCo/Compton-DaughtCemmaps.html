This road map shows the cemetery on the east side of Abernathy Rd. <br>
Location: Highway 31 North; right into Buford Station 
Road; left at Abernathy Road. On left on old Sam Smith place about 1/2 mile from 
road. 1987. </b></font><b>
<br>
Up to date more specific location: Go 
west on Highway 31 North from Pulaski several miles and turn right (east) on 
Buford Station Rd. Then take the first left on Abernathy Rd and go about a mile 
&amp; 1/2 or until the road curves sharply right. Next turn into the field road or 
operation road and on your right &amp; get permission at the farm operation building. Then continue on your journey past the gate (which stays 
open in the day) until the road forks. Take the left fork and bend on around to the 
left and the cemetery will be seen in the field under some trees inside a fence. 
The cemetery was fenced and maintained when I was there, It is at the end 
of a long field road, something under a mile from Abernathy Rd. <br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery under the small group of trees. The yellow 
highlighter shows the field road path to the cemetery from Abernathy Rd but don't be 
caught without permission back there because the owner may lock the gate on you. 
He has a time of the day to lock the gate in the afternoon I suppose when they 
are working in the building along the road the gate is open.<br>
