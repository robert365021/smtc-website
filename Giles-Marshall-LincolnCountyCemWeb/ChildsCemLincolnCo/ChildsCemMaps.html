Location: From 
Fayetteville go west on hwy 64 and turn right on Bradford Rd crossing Hughey 
Road and eventually Haysland Rd. Go a total of about 2 &amp; 7/10 miles to the 
Sulfur Springs Cemetery on your right. Pass on by that another 150 yards and 
with permission turn right into the middle of three residential driveways. This 
will be the one that goes by the right (east) side of the pond</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">. 
This will be the northern most home far back down the road. They keep horses and 
dogs so you will need instructions and safety knowledge. Be prepared for a 400 
yard walk across the pasture land.<br>

This is a rough outline in yellow also showing a fence row which cannot be 
damaged because of livestock needing its security. Carry a small aluminum ladder 
with you to get over the fence.<br>
