<p><b>The Findagrave.com crowd has 
done no survey of this cemetery. Sometimes if there is a horrible tale tied to 
an old cemetery the locals will avoid it. Most times it is because they favor 
their kin (known modern cemeteries). Other times, (I believe this time) is that 
this cemetery is old &amp; full of briars and the stones are hand made and very hard 
to read (except for the two formal markers). One must have training in bringing out the inscription to read these markers.<br>
<br>
The latest stone here is a military marker and it has fallen. This is for Mr. R. 
King Bennett. The link to read about his war and unit:[ 
http://www.tngenweb.org/franklin/frindwar.html ] <br>
<br>
Joseph McKelvy as we can see from all this was married to Jane Embrey McKelvy d. 
1844, Elizabeth Smith McKelvy d. 1849, and Rebecah (?) McKelvy. Rebecah is the 
first wife to show up (named) on the censuses (1850)<br>
<br>
The McKelvy family were early 
settlers of European descent.&nbsp; <br>
One set of initials N.M. that may be from the McKelvy individual that carved 
these inscriptions may have been N. McKelvy whose initials N.M. are on the 
bottom of the Matilda McKelvy monument. Could this be the Noah McKelvy mentioned 
as the husband of Matilda. who died on 18 Jun 1857. If so he &amp; his second wife Almira 
Jane Edins McKelvy are probably interred here without a headstone. He and she 
were still living in the 1880 Census shown below in green text. Since he was 
the one inscribing the stones there was no one to inscribe stones after his 
death. There is a marriage record to Jane Edins 
in 1858. I will add him because it seems normal in the course of events that if 
he could inscribed the tombstone for his (1st) wife that he outlived her. It is 
also natural to assume that his second wife outlived him because she has no 
tombstone here either.<br>
<br>
Individuals mentioned in the above cemetery listings but not found listed 
themselves are: Noah McKelvy/Margaret Smith/Christian Smith/Joseph McKelvy h/o 
Elizabeth Smith &amp; Rebecah (?) McKelvy. Was Tempy and Margaret Smith the same lady or two different 
marriages for Christian Smith? I am not related, but find this cemetery 
historically interesting. </b></p>
<p><b><u>Some Franklin County 
Bratton Family History.<br>
</u>John BRATTON was born in 1788 and died in 
1833 in Franklin County, Tennessee at age 45. Notes: 1781-1844 Marriage Records 
of Madison Co., Ky,
Bratton, John Bratton, m. Susannah pg 106 Jan 07 1810.<br>
Franklin Co., Tn - Biography:
John Bratton, 1788-1833 -
John Bratton married Susannah Burton in 1810, in Madison Co., KY. Their first 
child was born in KY. The family moved to Franklin Co., TN. about 1814 and 
settled along the Elk river near Estill Springs. Their second child Robert 
Franklin Bratton was born about 1814 in KY. or TN. and the other nine children 
were born in TN. John Bratton died in 1833 in Franklin Co., TN. (cannot find 
cemetery or a field where he is buried). Circuit court records name his widow 
and eleven children and also appoint his oldest son Monroe, as Guardian of the 
seven youngest children. His widow, with the eleven children (two or three of 
them already married) remained in TN. until moving to Barry Co., MO. in the 
mid-late 1838. (several other families from the Franklin, Co., TN. area also 
made the move to MO at the same time.
Susannah (BURTON) Bratton was the daughter of Samuel Burton, Jr. and Amy Oldham, 
she died in 1852 in Barry Co., MO.&nbsp;
After moving to MO, the descendants of John Bratton took on the surname spelling 
of Brattin. [if you have further interest in exploring this issue see this URL:<br>
[ http://www.thebrattonfamily.net/FT/THE%20BRATTON%20FAMILY/D3.HTML#C1632 ]</b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#CC3300">Comment by CWA: Estill Springs was about 5 to 8 miles northwest of here on the Elk River, but 
some of the Bratton descendants could have settled near this cemetery. Ok I am 
speculating but can anyone tell me why this cemetery is called the Braton 
(spelling probably not important) Cemetery on maps. No mention&nbsp; is made in 
the cemetery name of the the predominate McKelvy family who lived here and 
formed all these home-made monuments. They are inscribed and shaped out of 
common limestone. The other two surnames here are&nbsp; Richardson or Bennett. Every McKelvy grave I can 
identify has a footstone and headstone 
shaped with a round top and smoothed on the front side enough to hold a hand 
carved inscription.<br>
