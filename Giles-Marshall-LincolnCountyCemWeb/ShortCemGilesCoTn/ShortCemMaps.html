From Pulaski go south on Hwy 11 (Minor Hill Hwy) several miles and turn back north (right) on Short Road. 
Then go 
1/2  
a mile and turn right into a long driveway&nbsp; which Crosses the 
creek&nbsp;and follows the driveway that curves to your right around to a log 
home of a residence in the distance. The Short Cemetery is east (left0 of you upon a hill out 
in a clump of trees and cannot be seen without first climbing the hill. With 
permission veer your vehicle across the field pointing at an angle left away (east) 
from the log home and climb the steep hill to the crest and bend left (east) 
toward the tree grove you will see on your left. The grove of trees 
contains the cemetery. <br>
