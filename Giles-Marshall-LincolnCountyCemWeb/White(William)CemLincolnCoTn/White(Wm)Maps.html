Cooper Branch Rd and turn left. Go to Lloyd Chapel Rd and turn right. When 
that dead ends on Stephens Creek Rd turn left and the cemetery is up the slope on 
the left behind an old barn under the edge of the trees. This cemetery must be 
visited with the help of the current land owner Dr. Akin who has certain times

This topographical map shows the cemetery just up the slope from the Stephens 
Creek Rd about 200 yards. Park at the old Barn (which was at one time a store) next to the road where there is a 
gate and thru the gate and follow along the tree line 150 yards. Cross the tree 
line at the old&nbsp; (torn out) gate on the left and proceed up the slope 
another 100 yards north west veering right to stay in the clearing and then back 
left, due west, toward the next tree line where the one large obelisk monument 
can be found. The Cemetery was recently cleared and now is more easily found.<br>
