					[research by Paul White and Ginny Keefer several years ago]<br>
					<b>Unique look at the 1820-1830*</b> census showing the White family 
					in the neighborhood line up based on the Mulberry creek 
					locations of the East &amp; West fork branches, Lane mapping 
					by Nancy Austin Hall:<b>
					<a href="ausmap.jpg">MAP</a>/</b>neighbors on one page of 
					the <b>
					<a href="Austin,Drewry-Harris1830Census-Neighbors.jpg">1830 
					Census</a>. </b>For some reason Nancy Hall shows Wm White in 
					this map on the 1820 &amp; 1830 census in conflict with Ginny's 
					research who says Wm White came to Lincoln Co in 1824. I do 
					not know which is right. [CWA, 1 Jun 2013]</p>

					<b>* </b>The east/west fork 
					in the Mulberry Creek is located about 1 mile NW of this 
					cemetery which is the focus of this map.<br>
					<br>
					 </span>
					<span style="font-family: Courier New; color: #008000">The 
					pictures above of the small fieldstones, may have been grave 
					covers or footstones or even head stones. The several little 
					piles of rocks on the surface may have been placed on baby 
					graves. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
					<span style="font-family: Courier New; color: #008000">The 
					broken stone with initials M.V.W. is likely a foot marker 
					for Martha V. White, wife of James F. White. The foot marker 
					with the initials D.F.W. must be for Dianna Frances White 
					who is also on the obelisk. The rock held by someone which 
					begins with letters J. M. T. followed by non-discernible 
					scratching was interpreted as many ways as those who 
					ventured a guess. Other stones of various sizes are 
					scattered about with only assumptions as to their relation 
					to any graves.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
					<span style="font-family: Courier New; color: #008000">Joe 
					White had two wires that he used to douse for graves and 
					&quot;found&quot; evidence of more graves all over the small area 
					enclosed by a wire fence. There may be more tombstones 
					buried that we did not uncover, but my guess is that field 
					rock stones are all that some received to mark their grave.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
					<span style="font-family: Courier New; color: #008000">As to 
					whether our ancestor William White b. 1755 was buried here 
					we may never know for sure. However it is my belief that he 
					and his wife Elizabeth were indeed buried here, but never 
					had a marker. All of the names found were of the son James 
					Franklin White and his family. It was the desire of some 
					that a maker for William White, the Revolutionary Soldier 
					and his wife Elizabeth be erected here.&nbsp; [Jim Thomas, 25 
					Feb 2013]<br>
					<br>
					This is another William White of the area and it seems a 
					different one: 26 August 1851 reporting Fayetteville 
					Observer: Died: Maj. William White born in Virginia 4 Dec. 
					1764, and died in Gibson Co., (west) Tenn. July 30, 1851. At 
					the age of 16 he entered Washington's Army and fought at 
					Yorktown.... came to Tenn. about 45 years ago and settled 
					near Nashville. Dr. W.W. McNeely of Fayetteville is 
					descended from him....he left an aged wife. [Does seem to be 
					a different one. based on birth date. WA 18 Aug 2014]<br>
