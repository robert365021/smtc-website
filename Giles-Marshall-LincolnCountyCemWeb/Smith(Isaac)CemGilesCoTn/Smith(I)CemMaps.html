</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Location: Go 
west on Highway 64 bypass to Hwy 166 and turn south. Travel 7+ miles and turn 
right (west) on Hagan Rd. Follow that westward crossing over a ridge until it becomes 
(or turn right on) Shoal Creek Rd and then 
continue on until you pass the Liberty Hill Rd fork on your left. Continue on about 1.4 miles 
further northwest and look to your right at a locked gate and livestock catch 
pen over from that. With key from owner go thru locked gate amd up the slope (northeast) from that is an old 
falling down share croppers house. 
Follow the farm road behind the 
old share croppers house up the slope to a thicket which juts out and is on the left of the 
field road. The cemetery thicket juts out from the forested area. There was a 
fence there but it is falling down now leaving cattle running loose. The cemetery is on the left of the field road about 350 yards 
north from 
the Shoals Creek Road about 70 yards southeast of a cattle pond which cannot be 
seen as you walk up the road. The pond  
is hard to see because it is behind the trees and an incline.<br>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#800000" size="2">Lisa Oliver's instructions 
from Shoals Bluff Church: Leaving the 
Shoal Bluff Church &amp; Cemetery go southeast then turn left &amp; cross the bridge. 
Next turn left onto the Shoal Creek road like you were going to the Jackson 
Cemetery. After that turn look for the first old abandoned white farm house on the left and then 
look back right and across the road is a gate and catch pen. Behind that is an old 
falling down share croppers house. The graves are behind the share croppers 
house on the crest of a hill in 
a thicket.<br>
The farm was owned by Mr Winfred Dollins who passed away, but is still in the 
hands of his family. There are cattle present around the cemetery.</font></b><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
