				Two Iron fence enclosures are here, both fallen and no longer standing, to keep out the livestock.<br/>
Several unmarked graves, some with fieldstone still standing, others the fieldstones are trampled to the ground 
				by livestock.</p>
				<p>**All listings were from someone's family records as published in 
				the book Lincoln County Tennessee Cemeteries by Tim &amp; Helen 
				Marsh. No known markers exist for this cemetery. We don't know 
				if they were destroyed or never were there. I did a quick probe 
				of the soil, but no inscribed stones were found. For one thing the probe works 
				well to find lost stones in smaller areas, but this was a large 
				area, and would require a systemic approach taking at least a 
				couple of hours.

Added here 22 Jul 2012. Listing</i></b><i><b> from the same page in the book Cemetery Records of Lincoln County, 
Page 370 
by Tim &amp; Helen Marsh. Findagrave as of now has this cemetery incorrectly 
portrayed with inapplicable listings and no location information. They have 
recent burials and obituaries and recent listing posted to this 
cemetery. There is a large Campbell Cemetery in this county and that is the 
cause of the confusion with folks dumping their listings to the first Campbell 
Cemetery that comes up on the listing instead of the correct one.</b></i></p>
