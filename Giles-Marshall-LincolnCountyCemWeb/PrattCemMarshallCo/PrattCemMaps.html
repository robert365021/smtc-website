This map shows the GPS coordinates needed to find this cemetery as 35.68106 N X 
-86.821017 W. I am not aware of the exact location behind that house, but the 
likely area is under the trees behind the home.<br>

From Lewisburg north on Hwy 431 to Talley Moore Road and turn right. Go past 
Moore Cemetery to a sharp curve right and go instead straight ahead across a 
cattle gap. Next to left behind a home. Folks&nbsp; in the home keep the graves 
cleared of brush. If my maps are correct and this is the right cemetery it is in 
Maury County instead of Marshall County Tennessee. The faint dotted line on the 
above map represents the county line. So I am placing this cemetery in Maury 
County.</font></b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><i><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
