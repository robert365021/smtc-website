Directions from Lewisburg. Go southwest on Hwy 31 Alt/akaHwy11 past Cornersville 
to Ostella Road and turn left. Follow Ostella Road for over a mile and after the 
road bends back south (right) 90 degrees look to your left at the cemetery next 
to 
the road. Turn left into the cemetery road on the south west corner of the cemetery.<br>

This aerial map shows the general borders of the New Hope cemetery. I have 
divided it into three sections. Section A is very old with some new graves. 
Section B is the generally developed area of recent times with Section C being 
populated with new graves mostly from after year 2000.<br>
