	</font><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">William Clark White, born in 
	Lincoln County, Tennessee was murdered Christmas Eve, 1864 by Bushwhackers 
	who came to his farm. He had moved from Lincoln County, Tennessee from his 
	fathers old place near Mulberry thinking the political climate would be 
	better. He did not believe in slaves and kept none and sent no sons to fight 
	in Civil war. He gave to the soldiers what he had until his stock and 
	supplies were so low he was concerned. He had 8 children and a wife due in 
	less than a month. She delivered within 48 hours after her husband's murder. 
	He had two eldest sons, 15 and 16, to take the family into the woods and 
	hide them. The Bushwhackers were made up of neighbors along for the ride, a 
	Confederate leader and a young man named Benjamin Franklin Herrin of 
	Lawrence Co TN. They were all drinking. The young man said his Capt. forced 
	him to shoot White when he came out the door with his wife to talk to the 
	men. William's wife, son and daughter and some neighbors who followed the 
	group, but were hidden, stated all of the men were drunk and very pleased 
	over the murder. This is an interesting but sad story of the times just 
	after the Civil War. If you are interested in more on this story E-mail
