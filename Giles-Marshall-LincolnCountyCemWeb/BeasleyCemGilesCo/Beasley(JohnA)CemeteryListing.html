<p>In an adjacent fenced area there is a 
recent family member of the present inhabitants of the old John Andrew Kerr 
home. She is interred under a modern a monument. Names withheld because of 
privacy concerns.</p>
<p>The present owners of this property are 
the Lindsey family. This property was known in times past as the Kerr Farm 
having last been in the hands of surviving Kerr brothers &amp; sisters. The father 
was John Andrew Kerr and the mother's maiden name was Fogg. Prior to the Kerr 
family best I can tell this was the Beasley family property, but maybe another 
family in between. The home here was originally of log construction founded in 
1844 likely by John A. Beasley. Like many of the original homes it has been 
expanded and modernized over the years.&nbsp; As told to Mr. Lindsey by one of 
the remaining lady Kerr descendents in the 1960s.</p>
