  Here we have a road map which shows the cemetery off of Highway 166 on Hannah
  Road or called Hannah Hollow Rd on some maps.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  Location: Highway 64 West, right into Campbellsville Road, proceed about
3 miles, turn left into Hannah Road, Cemetery on left toward the end of the dead
end road.<br>
  </b><b>

  This aerial map shows the cemetery just to the left of the Hannah Road which
  becomes a residential road, toward the end, before the last house. If your intentions are
  honorable you will be welcomed to visit this cemetery by the local land owner.</b><b><br>
