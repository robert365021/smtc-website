Location: From 
Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64 several miles to the McBurg Community and turn 
left on the Old Hwy 64. Go past the McBurg Methodist Church 500 yards and the 
cemetery is south of the road on the Stevenson farm about 1/3 of a mile from the 
road. The graves are inside a block wall. It is far across the road from the&nbsp; 
Rambo Cemetery. Access seems closer from the McBurg/Dellrose Road but the 
property is not owned by the families along the west side of that road. Mr 
Stevenson is a likeable person and if you can work around his busy farm schedule 
he will probably accompany you to this cemetery. Otherwise with his permission 
you can visit here, but there are gates, live cattle and small creeks to be 
properly dealt with in making the long trek from the public road.</b></font><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080" size="2"><br>
