Marie was a kind and loving soul, a friend and mother to all. There was always a 
place for you at her table and never did she utter a harsh word against anyone. 
Born during the Depression, her life had many hardships yet many joys. Her 
greatest treasures in life were her family, her friends, her memories and her 
faith in God. Although her body failed, her love and faith never weakened.<br>
Those who lovingly remember her and are so saddened by her loss are her husband, 
Everett; son, Randy; sister-in-law Dot Clinard; uncle, Leroy Moore; and a myriad 
of nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. Mom, we miss you.<br>
If it were possible and I could turn back the pages of time,<br>
I'd like to visit once again, the kitchen that belonged to the Dear Mom of mine.

comfort to the dear mother at the gate of Nain, is still nigh. &nbsp;He who wept at

applied to this loveable mother. &nbsp;She was blessed with a meek and quiet spirit. 
&nbsp;She must have been under benign influence of that love that can &nbsp;suffer long 
and is kind. &nbsp;We trust that her beautiful life will live on in the hearts of 
those who knew her &nbsp;best. &nbsp;She filled all the relations of life with dignity and 
honor as a wife, mother, and friend. &nbsp;Her Christian character was as bright as 
her faith was sublime. &nbsp;Her funeral was conducted at her late home by the

On March 7, the Death Angel 
visited the home of Mr. and Mrs. John Phillips, near Appleton, and took from 
them their son Stephie. He suffered for about eighteen months with consumption, 
then Jesus in his wisdom called him home to rest, where he is free from all 
sorrow and pain. Stephie was dear to us all and through all his suffering he was 
always cheerful. At home and at school he greeted us all with a smile. A father, 
a mother, three brothers and four sisters are left to mourn his death. 
Everything possible was done to save the life of this beloved one. But loving 
care and tender ministrations could not avail against disease and death. Weep 
not loved ones but be diligent about your Master�s work until you go to join him 
in that beautiful home above. The funeral services were conducted by Rev. J. E. 
Legg, in the presence of a large congregation of relatives and friends. After 
which the remains were laid to rest in the Dobbin�s Cemetery.<br>
