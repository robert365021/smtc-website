WATSON, Sarah E., 3 Feb 1862 - 9 Oct 1939. (no stone found this survey.) � this 
woman�s maiden surname was Hasten aka Hastings, dau of John Hastings and Paralee 
Ann Holbert. John Hasten (note surname spelling change from Hastings) was 1st 
born son of Ezekiel Hastings and Elizabeth Dunnavant, dau of Abel burton 
Dunnavant. Paralee Holbert�s 2nd husband was George W. Bass by whom she had a 
houseful of kids. Buried in the cemetery are 3 graves I�m related to:<br>
<br>
(1) Sarah E. Hasten Watson aka Mamie Lizzie to her grandkids and g-grandkids.<br>
(2) James Peru Watson<br>
(3) John H. Watson, son of Sarah E. and James P. Watson<br>
<br>
In 1998 when I visited this cemetery we found all three Watson stones; but we 
had to poke around with stick and it took us a good hour or so. Photos were 
taken but the camera�s film was damaged on our return flight to Washington DC. I 
seem to recall Dan dropped it while we were boarding the flight. We lost all the 
photos of the Hastings reunion, Zack R. Hasten�s CSA tombstone marking ceremony, 
etc. <br>

More detail on this family buried here and down in the Hasting Cemetery south of 
Ardmore along the I-65 corridor<br>

Sarah Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; or &quot;Mamie Lizzie&quot; Hasten was the wife of James Peru 
Watson. She was daughter of John Hasten and Paralee Holbert whose 2nd husband 
was George Washington Bass. John Hasten went off to Civil War and per some of 
Mamie Lizzie�s grandsons, who recalled her taking them each year to the 
decoration day ceremonies at the Hasting Cemetery at Ardmore. <br>
Accordingly these grandsons told this account that Mamie would cook all week 
long getting ready for the wagon trip to the Hasting Cemetery. On the day before 
the trip, she�d take everyone out to the pastures and collect toe sacks full of 
wild flowers to decorate the graves with. They said Mamie Lizzie always said her 
dad, John Hasten, got leave to come home for a hog killing. That one day after 
the war and after the meat was made available, he took it into Athens for 
further processing. On the way home, a few miles from the Ezekiel Hastings farm, 
he was bushwhacked by Yankee soldiers who chased his wagon causing it to 
overturn, throwing John from the wagon and breaking John�s back/neck. The yanks 
slung his body across their horse and took it to the Ezekiel Hastings farm and 
dumped it in the yard. <br>
He�s supposed to be in one of the four unmarked graves in Hastings cemetery � 
I�ll describe where later, but at mid-point of the main cemetery in the first 
row nearest the circular road. John was buried (per Mamie Lizzie�s grandsons) 
next to his parents, and sister Lucy. <br>
In the early 1890�s Mamie Lizzie inherited John�s share of Ezekiel Hasting(s) 
estate and used it to buy a farm in GCT for herself and bridegroom James Peru 
Watson. Mamie Lizzie, James Peru Watson and a son John H. �Buster� are buried in 
the Osburn/Watson Cemetery. <br>
FYI, Rita Birdsong�s husband is one of Mamie Lizzie�s younger g-grandsons. Rita 
tells me the story is not the same one told to the late Loraine Story (my 
grandpa Ernest Hasten�s cousin) in the 1950�s and 1960�s, and then in the late 
1990�s the same story told to me by the Poston and Harwell descendants of Mamie 
Lizzie. I think Rita got her story from the Birdsong/Bass descendants and they 
claim John just never came home from the war period and no one knew what 
happened to him. <br>
<br>
My grandpa�s cousin interviewed Rita�s husband�s mother in the 1950�s and 1960�s 
before senility set in and the story Rita�s mother-in-law told at that time was 
essentially the same one I heard when I interviewed the Harwell�s and Poston�s 
who descend from Mamie Lizzie confirming my account.<br>
