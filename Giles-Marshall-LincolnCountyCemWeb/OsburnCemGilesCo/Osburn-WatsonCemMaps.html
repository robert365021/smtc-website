</b></font><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080" size="2">Location: Hwy 
64E, right on Pisgah Road, turn right north side of church, on road marked as 
Braly Hollow Rd., go about 2 miles and the road merges with Indian Creek Road 
coming from the northeast. Go about a 1/2 mile and turn right into the long 
driveway and the gentleman there may accompany you to the cemetery if you give 
him advance notice. This was the Jim Sanders Place in 1986. The cemetery is upon a 
steep slope on your left as you near the house at the end of the drive about 500 
yards due south of you in a stand of trees as marked on the below map. It is 
also across a creek where you will get your feet wet without boots.</font></b><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

With this aerial map we see the cemetery as outlined by the yellow highlighter 
near the top of the irregular shaped stand of trees. The creek goes in a circle 
around the base of the steep hill. North of this place is the residential road 
to the home as seen in the first map above.<br>
