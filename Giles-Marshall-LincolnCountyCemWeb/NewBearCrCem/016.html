PICKENS, Lochard Meredith, 8 Sep 1870 - 21 Dec 1944.<br>
PICKENS, Delta Orr, 28 Mar 1881 - 1 Mar 1958. (wife of Lochard M. Orr)<br>
(This memorial is of the modern granite style yet it is breaking up. The death
date for Delta Orr is 1958 not 1956 as previous researchers have reported. The
broken part with the death date of &quot;8&quot; as in &quot;1958&quot; is
visible above. I found
and placed it safely between this memorial and the one on our right away from the
mowers. [WA 3/10/08])<i><br>
