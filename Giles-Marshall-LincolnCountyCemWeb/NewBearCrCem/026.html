ORR, Walter V., 17

This little memorial is breaking up even though it is of the modern hard granite
composition. I just wonder if this is lawnmower damage from mowing too close.
The black marks are clues indicating that. Whom ever did this left evidence that
it was from more than one encounter.&nbsp;<i><br>
