<p align="center"><b>A REMARKABLE FAMILY - The Pulaski 
Citizen 02 Dec 1896<br/>
</b><br/>
<b>The last, of the older members of an interesting and 
remarkable family died near Waco the 29th Instantly. Many years ago James 
Boatright, coming from Williamson County here, settled about 2 � miles, west of 
Waco. He was a cabinet maker and in his young manhood left Virginia and went to 
Germantown, N. C. From there he moved to Williamson County, coming on here a few 
years afterward. His first wife was Nancy George. Of this marriage, there were 
three children, Daniel, James, Jr., and Elizabeth. Daniel married Margaret 
English, They were the father and mother of I. N. Boatright, Mrs. R. M. Bugg and 
Miss Kittie Boatright, now living in Lynnville, and of English and Tom Boatright, 
both deceased. James, Jr., married Annie Moody and settled on Big creek. 
Elizabeth married Matthew Sims. They moved to Arkansas and died there. James 
Boatright's second wife was Deborah West. Of this marriage there were six 
children�Mary, Nancy, Sally, William, Joel and John. Mary married John McKnight.<br/>
William married Martha Foster. Sally, Nancy, Joel and John were all deaf and 
dumb, lived to a great age and were never married. Sally and Nancy died in 1893, 
one with in three days of the other. Joel died in January of this year at the 
age of 89. John Boatright sustained some serious injuries from a severe fall 
about three weeks ago and never recovered from them. He died Monday afternoon at 
the age of 88 and was buried Tuesday at 2 o'clock, Rev. Allison Molloy 
conducting the service. Four graves, side by side, in the old Bailey grave yard, 
mark their resting place. They seemed to lead happy lives and were respected and 
loved by all who knew them.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>* Genealogy included the link above mentions her as Nancy 
Pendleton and on this page as Nancy George. Beware, this is your call,  I 
do not know which is right. <br/>
** Deaf &amp; dumb meaning the speech is impeded because they cannot hear the words 
correctly, so they did not learn to pronounce words plainly. Most are of average 
or higher intelligence.<br/>
