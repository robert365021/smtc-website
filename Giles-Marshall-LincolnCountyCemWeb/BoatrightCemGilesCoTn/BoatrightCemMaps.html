  From the above map we see the James Boatright Cemetery GPS location. It is&nbsp; 
at Lat/Long N 35.9971 X W 87.06771. <br>

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Going South on I-65 take Exit 27 
and go thru Lynnville to Waco aka Old Lynnville then left (south) on Hwy 31 for a few hundred 
yards where you will turn right on the Yokley to Waco Road. Follow that for a couple of 
miles and look to you right at a brick home and barn that sits in front of the 
cemetery. The Cemetery 
is on the hill above and behind the barn at the top of a steep hillock. 
Proper right of way and access to this cemetery I am not aware of. I found the 
owner gone so I took my ladders and set them up to scale over the fences to prevent damage 
and got into the cemetery that way. The real access must be from 
the old John &quot;Doc&quot; Barlar place to the north and from the west side. The cemetery is nicely fenced but with a 
solid 
gate, but the weeds were head tall and had to be mashed down to make the photos. 
Remember there are cattle all around here that do not need to be disturbed. </b></font>

  Here we see the red check showing the location on a hillock where this 
cemetery resides. I should remind you this is all private property except the 
cemetery so needs permission to visit to keep down any disagreement with the 
land owner.<br>

I have depicted various details in this mapping. It is clear enough to make 
out the corners of the fence and reflections of the light colored stones in this 
cemetery. Where the Cattle fence is labeled there is no gate along that fence 
anywhere so your real access is from the north side of the cemetery from the old 
John &quot;Doc&quot; Barlar home-place. There is a locked gate on that road so to get past 
that and into this field where the cemetery resides is another question of whom 
to see. Doc Barlar (still existing house, northwest 300 yards) lived from 
1861 to 1949 and is my (C. Wayne Austin) great-great uncle. He owned this farm 
in his adulthood. They used to have reunions here every year on the anniversary 
of his marriage beginning on the 50th year and big gatherings occurred with 
usually more then 50 kin folk present. See Mid Tennessee Cousins web site. Also 
for that one see Barlar.org.<br>
