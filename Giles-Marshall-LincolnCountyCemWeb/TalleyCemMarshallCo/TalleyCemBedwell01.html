Heaven gained the sweetest angel last night. One who 
brightened the life of anyone she met. My sweet Nana always put her family first 
putting every ounce of love she had into every holiday, birthday, vacation or 
just a simple visit. She had a heart of gold that made us each feel special and 
loved to the core, her smile could brighten the darkest day, her hugs warmed our 
hearts and were full of love, and she listened to every word we said and 
although she might not always agree, she supported us. Nana could correct you 
with a simple look...we called them the big eyes. I spent many nights with my 
Nana and Granddaddy at all stages of my life. We'd bake and decorate cookies, 
make homemade biscuits, go see Christmas lights, read Santa Mouse, sing, play, 
watch TV, and I guarantee never leave there hungry because there was always time 
for a snack. I had the pleasure of working with her at the preschool. Her love 
for her students and job only inspired me more to become a teacher myself. My 
treasured memories of my Nana could go on and on forever. She was not only my 
Nana she was one of my very best friends. Thank you Nana for teaching us how to 
love each other and focus on the importance of family and thank you for teaching 
us to be strong. I pray that I can grow to be more like you every day of my 
life. You truly were the most amazing person I've ever known. Your Christian 
example and our memories will stay with us forever. We know now you aren't 
suffering anymore and you will always be with us in our hearts. We love you more 
than could ever be imagined and we'll see you again one day.<u><br>
