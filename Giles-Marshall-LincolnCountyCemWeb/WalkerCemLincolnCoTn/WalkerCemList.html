<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">This cemetery is 
infested with Privy Hedge and contains about 6 gravestones lined up in one row.</span><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
Any other analysis is difficult because of the dense brush. You will likely have 
to cut your way into this cemetery so be armed with Lopping Shears, the kind 
that will cut limbs and shrub up to 1 1/2 inches thick. I cut enough Privy hedge 
to get the photos. This cemetery needs to be cleared, but where is family or 
someone that cares??<b><br>

</font></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">As I 
approached the cemetery something scampered out of the thicket and back toward 
the road. I looked up to see an animal which I believe could have been a cross 
between a dog and a coyote. It bolted out of the thicket and was scrambling so 
fast to get away that I could not get a good look, but it had the size, thick 
body &amp; long hair of a Shepherd dog, and the coloring of a red Labrador 
Retriever, but the facial features &amp; head of a Coyote or Wolf. Now that was a 
scary encounter as the animal scrambled so hard to get away I could literally 
see its muscles rippling and hear the hard thumping on the ground. It ran in a 
crouched position much like a stalking cat does. It bolted out of the thicket &amp; 
down the field to the bank of the road, into to the hedge row and out again to 
cross the road. All that to get away from me. It disappeared into the forest 
across the road. I had never seen an animal like that, but have long been 
suspicious that dogs were possibly inter-breeding with coyotes producing a 
strange looking wild dog that acted something between a wolf and a coyote. I 
know that it was wild &amp; not a domestic because I have never seen a dog hide and 
run that way to get away. They call those Dingoes in Australia. Wonder what they 
will call them here? Truth of the matter every time a Coyote crosses with a dog 
there is a new breed which lives or dies, and when the cross gets the traits of 
a dog it quickly succumbs for lack of ability to hunt. If it inherits the 
survival traits of the Coyote, no matter what it looks like, it acquires very 
cunning traits that allows it to survive and interbreed again in adulthood.<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><b><br>
