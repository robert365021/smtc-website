located since most cemeteries are located upon higher ground &amp; above the flood 
plain.<br>

1st dirt road to right.</b><font color="#000080" size="2"><b> 
We offer no GPS location here because this cemetery has not been mapped in the 
past on USGS records. Thus we only know the vague directions printed in the book 
Giles County Tennessee Cemeteries by the Historical Society about 1986. </b>

  Perhaps this Aerial Map shows the dirt road in the curve of the road where 
this cemetery can be found but this is unproven and may not be helpful. While 
visiting the Tackett Cemetery I did ask Mr. Arnold Williams about the location 
of this cemetery and he was not aware of it. By the way since I made this map 
the yellow plot is not the location of this cemetery as that is in the creek bed 
and low ground - not a place to find a cemetery.</b><br>
