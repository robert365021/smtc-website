<p align="center"><b>This is the map to the New
Hebron (I think AKA New Hebrew shown on the signage photos) Church. This church
may not be connected to the Cemetery in any way, but if I have the church
location correct can be used to find this cemetery in back of the church. Faye
said they were on the Lewisburg Highway but was lost as to the exact location
but this appears to be correct based on the details. The cemetery is down a road
behind the church - exact distance is unclear to me since the cemetery is not
marked on GSIS Mapping. Here we have provided the location of the Church and not
the Cemetery as provided by Topozone. The cemetery is further west than the GPS
shown above behind the church just north of Maury/Marshall County boundary on
the Marshall County side.</b> </p>

<b>I have an arrow pointing in back of the New
Hebrew church to where I believe the cemetery is located on a small road leading
behind the church some 300 yards into a small clearing seen on this map. I have
highlighted the road in yellow, but do not guarantee this is the correct location.
I have not been here to verify this. WA 29 Apr 2010<br>
