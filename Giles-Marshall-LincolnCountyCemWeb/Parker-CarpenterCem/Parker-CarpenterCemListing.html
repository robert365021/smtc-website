<br>
Melissa &amp; Jeff Atkins, the photographers here, were unable to get photos of all the stones due to
the dense saw briars and brush infestation next to a well manicured lawn.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<font size="2">This cemetery is among the worse grown up I have seen and I think I
know the reason. While the cemetery was enclosed by a chain link fence, it is infested
from a growth of weeds, vines &amp; trees. It has been allowed to grow up the last
several years in a very harmful way to this cemetery. It is in extreme danger of
being lost from neglect. Tree roots will invade the graves and render the
headstones out of level&nbsp; causing them to topple to the ground and break
among other things.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The main culprit here is a very serious issue of disagreement and permission
with the land owner who will not allow anyone to come there and clean the
cemetery or even visit it for photos and make condition checks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I (Wayne Austin) first went there 5 Nov 2009 to do minor cleaning so that I
could make photographs for this site. I went to the owner for permission and was greeted by a lady (whom I will not
name) who promptly ordered me off the land in a very mean spirited
manner. Since I wanted no conflict with anyone I left.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When I discussed this issue with Faye Bradford who helps me with this site I
discovered she is a descendent of the Carpenters interred in this
cemetery.&nbsp; She was devastated that someone would act in such a manner
against her ancestor's graves. She has a deep abiding respect toward those who
came before her. She with her daughter resolved to use the new laws respecting
descendents as the primary owners of the cemetery plots and thus the cemetery to
attempt to gather the photos needed for this site. The above photos though not
complete were collected with their efforts. They deserve our applause for
attempting to get past the &quot;troll under the bridge&quot; to gather and
offer to the public the above images.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I don't believe we have seen the end of this conflict.&nbsp;We are aware of
our rights to respect those good folks that once lived on this green
earth. They deserve our devotion to the upkeep of their graves and at the same
time respect the rights of the land owner even though he or she&nbsp;viciously
allows a terrible cycle of infestation of growth to this once pristine little
cemetery. It is so odd&nbsp;the owners&nbsp;take pride in the beauty of the grass next
to the cemetery and allow this. While I agree the pretty grass next to this cemetery is none of
my business, it is weird to me that folks will care so deeply for their lawns
and allow adjacent brush to destroy a cemetery which is just as much a part of their
land environment. Its as if they are trying to hide the cemetery.</font></p>
