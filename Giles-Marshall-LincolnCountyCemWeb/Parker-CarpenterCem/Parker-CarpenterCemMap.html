<p align="center"><b>PARKER-CARPENTER CEMETERY,
(Ball Hollow Rd) GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE&nbsp;<br>
</b><img border="0" src="Parker-CarpenterCemRdMap.JPG" width="952" height="413"><br>
Location: Take Highway 64 West from Pulaski and
turn north (right) into
Campbellsville Road, after several miles turn right into Minnow Branch Road,
then right into Apple Hill Road then left on Ball Hollow Road,
cemetery on left side of the front yard of a brick house. If you attempt to
visit this cemetery one of the owners will bury you with negative verbiage. Best
we can determine the another owner or party acts as a calming agent for the mean
one. I cannot guarantee you will be able
to visit this cemetery, because of the dense growth and the issues with the
owner. So the cemetery perishes from neglect. Is that what the public wants with
literally thousands of persons around the country that descends from the
interred here?&nbsp; Evidently prior to this owner it has been well cared for in
the past with fencing and the stones (we can see) all still standing, but that
won't last long under the present circumstances.&nbsp;<br>
The cemetery is marked with a small red check on the above map.<br>
