This is the pile of stones that may have at one time marked graves. Another possibility
is that these stones formed the base of a box tomb, but where is the top. A
third possibility is that these stones may just be a grave liner for one
unmarked grave.<br>

We see from this photo two fieldstones out on the edge of the ledge between us
and the green clump of briars. These mark graves. The graves in this cemetery
lie to our left of the stones&nbsp;<br>
