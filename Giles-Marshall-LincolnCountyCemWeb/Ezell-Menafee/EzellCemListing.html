<p align="center"><b>Restoration notes</b><br>
I could easily have stood most of these stones
back up, but it endangers the stones to do so. Cattle are still in this cemetery
and they would knock them down again endangering the stones with
another fall and further risk of breakage. A fence is needed and then probably
brush killer should be sprayed at least once a year to keep the growth in check.
I suppose it should be checked to see if the brush killer is safe around cattle
though. Surprisingly there seems not to be any missing stones or parts of stones
here. However the <a href="EZunmark.html"><b> unmarked grave records</b></a> are destroyed by someone who collected
most of the stones and threw them under a tree on one side of the cemetery.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" color="#BB2206"><b>Family History Note</b><br>
This was once the John Menafee
place, and he still owned it at the time that Mary Jane Jones died in 1840; he
sold the place to William Ezell before 1850 and moved to Madison Co., Alabama
near Hazel Green.<br>
Marriage records in the Jones family Bible indicate that Martin S. Jones and Mary
Jane Mennifee were married on 17 December 1833; the marriage was also reported
in the Nashville Banner and Advertiser on 21 December 1833. Bible records
indicate also that Mary Jane Menefee was born 20 September 1812, the daughter of
John Menefee and his wife Mary/Polly (Renfro) Menefee.&nbsp;<i><br>
