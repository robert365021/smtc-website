KERR, Mary, 12 Mar
1796 - 14 Jun 1877. (wife of Henry Kerr and daughter of James Ford one of the
earliest settlers in the Giles County.)<br>
Mary Kerr was the wife of Henry Kerr and daughter of James Ford one of the
earliest settlers in the Giles County. See page 612 of the reprinted Giles
County Lineage Book.&nbsp;<br>
Also 83, 84, and 85 of McCallum's Early History of Giles County. Besides Henry
Kerr, there also was a Hugh Kerr and Benjamin B Kerr in the early censuses. I
have not made any connection with our James Kerr family and do not know if Hugh
&amp; Benjamin are related to Henry.&nbsp;<i><br>
