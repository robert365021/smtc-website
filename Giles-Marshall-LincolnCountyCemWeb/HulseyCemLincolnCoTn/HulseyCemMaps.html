This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Hulsey Cemetery as N 35.17480 X W 
86.51751. This shows a very straight access road to the cemetery which does not 
exist.<br>

Fayetteville go east on Hwy 64 to Hwy 50 and turn (left) north. Go less than 1/2 
mile and turn east (right) on Providence Rd. then back north on Providence Rd. 
again. When the road starts to bend to the east go into the road into that 
neighborhood and go about 2/3 of a mile to the last house on the right who can 
direct you to this cemetery. It is further on north past the buildings and pond 
of that home and into the woods enough to make it a bit hard to spot.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

This map shows better the small pond in relation to where the cemetery is 
located in the woods. In other words 30 yards northeast of the pond. Do not 
confuse this pond for the larger one south of it about 100 yards. <br>
