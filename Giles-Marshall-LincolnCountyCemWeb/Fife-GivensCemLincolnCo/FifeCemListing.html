For a cemetery so easily accessible this cemetery was found in bad shape. The 
stone of Elizabeth Fife was buried head first 3 feet into the ground and it was 
a job to dig and loosen it up enough to extract it then cover the hole left. The 
2nd upright stone was broken in half and the top half with inscription was 
missing except for a couple of small fragments. third upright that of Mary K 
Wells was broken in the center so badly that only the name remained readable. 
The three box tombs were dismantled and scattered parts were everywhere with the 
top of the Jane Givens monument buried under other parts. It had to be extracted 
to show for the photos and one part only weigh abt 200# pounds. These box tombs 
have two ends two sides a base and a top where the inscription resides but all 
that is not so visible here.</p>
