(Weakley Creek Rd., near county line) LAWRENCE COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br>
</b><b>

This map shows the coordinates of the Yarbrough Cemetery.
This is about half-way between Pulaski &amp; Lawrenceburg Tennessee just inside the 
county Lawrence Line.<br>

This road map shows the route needed from Pulaski to get to this
cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
Location: Highway 64 west to Weakley Creek road. North or left there and follow 
Weakley Creek Road as it winds its way up to and finally into Lawrence County. 
Then after another 1/3 of a mile 
turn north (right) into the private drive. Back about 100 yards prior to 
reaching the house turn northeast across the open field directly toward and up the 
slope to the far northeast corner of that open field. Park there and the cemetery is 
across the fence into the woods with gravestones clustered by family over about 
a 1/4 acre tract.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery inside the edge of the woods on the side 
of the hill. Using this map about the &quot;6&quot; of CR-936 turn north into the private 
drive and ask the precious elderly lady there if it is OK, then back about 100 
yards prior to the house turn northeast across the field directly toward and up 
the slope to the northeast corner of that open field. The cemetery is 
across the fence into the woods occupying about 1/4 of an acre of land. Strangely 
there is a north/south fence that divides the cemetery in half. Do not go onto 
this private property if your aims are less than honorable as the neighbors will 
surely interrupt your aims.<i>
