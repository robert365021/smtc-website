<br>
Extract of Obituary: Mrs. Jane S. Maxey, age 43, on the 31st of July 1852, died 
of Pulmonary Consumption, died on Weakley Creek (community), wife of Isaiah T. 
(Thomas) Maxey. Mrs. Maxey had been for 18 to 20 years an exemplary member of 
the Baptist Church and died in hope of a blessed immortality.<br>
<br>
Unmarked grave. This is the most likely place of burial for Jane since the 
church she and her husband &amp; children attended is/was very near this graveyard 
and they had connections to the Yarbrough family. This little graveyard most 
likely served the Primitive Church as its graveyard even though we do not find 
deeds making it a public burial ground.<br>
<br>
Age 43 when she died, so birth date about 1809, she was the 1st wife of Isaiah 
Thomas Maxey. Believed to be the daughter of John Larkin Higdon.<br>
<br>
I.T. Maxey would marry Eliza Warden an unmarried middle aged lady who was the 
daughter of James &amp; Mary Warden of the Campbell Station in Maury County 
Tennessee. I.T. &amp; Eliza would have one more child, a daughter named Virginia 
Arietta Maxey who married Hiram Brewer.<br>
<br>
She lived with her husband in Giles County on the Giles County side of the 
Lawrence/Giles County line on Weakley Creek (Weakley creek Road) between Pulaski 
&amp; Lawrenceburg Tennessee.<br>
