This (shown above) is the area of the American Chestnut restore project near to the Cemetery. 
This Ridge Top (Chestnut Ridge) was named after the tree they are tying to 
restore here. The American Chestnut tree was a valuable resource of lumber and 
food source from the nuts. It was lost in the 1930s - 1940s to a blight that 
killed all of them in this area. Revival of that species is to be greatly 
desired as long as it involves a tree that has similar characteristics to the 
fast growing giant tree that once inhabited much of the eastern hill country of 
North America. I used to roam over my grandfather's farm in Maury County in the 
late 1950's and noticed there were sprouts all around that grew up to about 20 feet 
only to be destroyed again by the blight. The sprouts would then spring up again in an 
effort to reach maturity only to be engulfed in the same cycle. The was going on 
all over on my Grandfather's 120 acre hilly farm called Barlar Springs (named 
after him.)<br>
There is a Chinese Chestnut tree that is quite common today that grows to about 
50 feet tall, but the American Chestnut Tree was a giant tree growing as tall as 
90 to 100 feet with massive 10' trunks. The harvested wood was very hardy and 
survived in the weather elements for a long time. Many log houses were built of 
the wood. There are many logs still in existence today from that tree. <br>
I don't know the details of the project or how they are attempting to resurrect 
this tree, but with all the biological technology today I am sure it is 
plausible. There may be patents in progress on this. It may involve DNA and/or 
genetics used to build resistance to the blight that killed millions of these 
trees in the 1930s around the eastern and southern forest. If
