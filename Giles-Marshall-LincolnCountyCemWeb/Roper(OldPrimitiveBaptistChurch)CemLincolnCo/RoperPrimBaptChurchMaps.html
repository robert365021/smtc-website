  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Take Highway 110 (Fayetteville to 
Ardmore) and go several miles, past Skinem and past Taft and go about 2 miles 
past Taft to the Church on the left side of the highway. The Roper Cemetery (new 
section) is in the 
church yard to the east of the building while the Roper Predestined Primitive 
Baptist (old section) is on the west side and allowed to grow up in weeds. The highway bends there to avoid 
running into the cemetery and church property.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows the plot where the cemetery resides next the old Roper 
Primitive Baptist Church marked with the Google map pointer. Some of the stones 
are very old 
and fragile and therefore easily damaged by overzealous people so be 
gentle on these soft monuments if you have business here. <br>
