<i>Studying this information tells us David A. &amp; Margaret E. Gooch had baby
daughter Lucy. Lucy &amp; (mother) Margaret died within one month of each other
in 1841, probably related to difficulty in the birthing process. This tragedy
was repeated time and time again in those days. David would live only 9 more years after this. --
and we think we have it hard today.<br>
A large old Cedar Tree stump is behind this stone. It may be there another
hundred years. The wood is very durable. It is also likely the tree was
there when the child was interred in 1841.<br>
