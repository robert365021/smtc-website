This road map by MS Streets &amp; Trips shows with the Yokley Cemetery (Hannah-Yokley)
Cemetery north of Campbellsville off of Hwy 166 on the right.&nbsp;Location:
Highway 64 West from Pulaski; right (or north several miles to Campbellsville;
turn N. E. on the (old Columbia to Campbellsville Rd) graveled Yokley Road.
Immediately on your right is the possibly locked gate to cemetery. Open the gate
and follow the road across the bridge over the creek and bear left up thru the
clearing to the cemetery. Glimpses of the cemetery can be seen from Hwy 166 in
the wintertime. This cemetery is fenced. If you go there do so with respect for
the vast history &amp; heritage present in this place. A visit there for the
wrong reasons will bring the local protective citizens and the law to bear upon
you.&nbsp;<br>

<b>With this aerial
map we can see the cemetery in the clearing with a road spanning from Hwy 166.
The white road drawn on this map is not quite correct. The actual road to the
cemetery from Yokley Cemetery Road winds around a bit more northward from there.<br>
