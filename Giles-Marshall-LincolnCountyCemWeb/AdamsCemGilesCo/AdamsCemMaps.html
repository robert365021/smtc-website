This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Adams Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="AdamsCemRd.jpg" width="1600" height="778"><br>
Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski and turn west (right) on Crescent View aka 
Thompson Road. Go nearly a mile and the road turns back north or right. From 
there bear or turn left into a gravel road. After about 400 yards the gravel 
road turns back left (southeast). Continue on and go past a small creek getting 
your tires wet. After that look left and as you climb a slope the cemetery tree 
line can be seen way out in a wheat field about 300 yards under a small clump of 
trees as seen on the next two maps.<br>

Same map - not cluttered up with the yellow highlighter. If you visit please respect the 
crop being grown here and not cross into the cemetery when the crops are green 
and subject to being trampled upon.<br>
