To get to this cemetery go 
up Hwy 231 from Fayetteville. Just after you pass Cold Springs Road the cemetery 
is upon the hilltop behind and above the 2nd house on the left. If you turn on 
Cold Springs road the couple living in the second house on right Road has a gate 
into the cemetery but they do not own the property around the cemetery. They are 
friendly toward visitors. (this is actually the third driveway. The first 
driveway does not have a house, but appears to be some sort of business.<br>
