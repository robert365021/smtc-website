  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Going South on I-65 take Exit 1 and 
turn right on Hwy 31. Go about 2 1/2 miles and after crossing over Elk River Bridge enter Elkton. Next 
while still climbing the hill turn right into the service road and back right 
again and immediately turn up a steep unpaved drive before you. When you are 3/4 of the 
way up the steep drive turn right into the cemetery service road. The cemetery 
sprawls out south/north and east/west from there. The old Cumberland Pres. 
Church sits in the corner of the cemetery southeast side and the front door 
faces north with the church building spanning back south. I am unaware of the history 
of this church but if it follows normal patterns in the south it may have stated 
as a white church for whites and slaves and then left for use by the black 
worshippers sometimes after the civil war. I think the old Elkton Cumberland 
Church Cemetery for white worshippers is across just east somewhere from this 
cemetery though I have not yet visited it because of the difficulty of finding 
the few remaining graves. Perhaps it is north across Mulberry St. and/or Bluff 
St somewhere. </b></font>

  Here we see the how close to Hwy 31 the cemetery is, except it is behind trees 
and on a hill overlooking the river and highway. This is the old Elkton African American 
cemetery, but is still active and maintained today.<br>
