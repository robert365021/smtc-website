  This large open area of the cemetery likely has the unmarked graves of many of
  the missing Phillips family who lived in this area and were early pioneers
  here.<br>
  Missing from the grave records are these family members which are all the
  family members who were the first three generations of founders of this
  community including land owners farmers Grain Mill Founders and Operators.
  Missing and presumed buried somewhere in this cemetery and maybe in this open
  area are:</font></b></p>

  1860 in Giles Co Tn. (Census taker of 1860 found them in the Bodenham

  James his wife Bettie Phillips.)<br>

  Others unaccounted for in this family are sons of James Alfred
  &quot;Alfred&quot; Phillips. Found in the 1860 census were: John W. Phillips
  b. 1830, Alfred R. Phillips b. 1838, Nathaniel Phillips, b. 1841. All three of
  these men were fighting age and John W. &amp; Nathaniel Phillips have records
  of showing service in the Confederate States Army. John W. Phillips married
  Lucy Ashworth and his descendent show up in Lawrence County Tn. He may have
  transferred to that county just west of Giles but Lucy Ashworth his wife seems
  to be a Giles County lady.</b></font></p>
