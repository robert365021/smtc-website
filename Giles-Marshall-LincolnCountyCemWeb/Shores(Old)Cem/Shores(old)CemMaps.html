  This topographical map from Topozone shows the GPS coordinates of the Old
  shores Cemetery sometimes called Shores on the Hill to differentiate it from
  all the other Shores Cemeteries in Giles County. I believe the GPS coordinates to be accurate.</font><font size="2" color="#008000"><br>

  11 (the Minor Hill Road). From Highway 11 southwest of Pulaski take Fall River
  Road north westward and meander and branch left on Mill Creek Road. After looping
  around and crossing the East Fork of the Shannon Creek almost immediately turn
  right &amp; go up the hill on Long Shore Road for 150 yards. The cemetery will
  be on your right inside a chain link fence. Alternate instructions: Location:
  Highway 11, right at Anthony Hill, bear right. Cemetery on left on hill about
  1 mile south &amp; beyond the Shores church of Christ.</font><font color="#008000" size="2"><br>

  This aerial view shows the Shores Cemetery the loop around &amp; crossing of
  the East Fork of the Shannon Creek. On your left inside this loop is the site
  of the Old Shores Mill owned and founded by Alfred Phillips, 1806-1881 then
  later sold to James Shores. The old mill stone sits in the yard of the nearby
  house today.&nbsp;</font></b><font color="#006666"><b><font size="2">
