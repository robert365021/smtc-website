  <p>Printed in the Pulaski Citizen Thursday
  April 7, 1881. Written by his son James Jordan Phillips.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>&quot;Our Father is Dead.&quot;</i></p>
  <p><i>Alfred Phillips was born 19th March, 1806,
  in Cheatham County N.C., emigrated to Giles County, Tennessee, in the fall of
  182_, and on the 21st of December 1828, he was united in matrimony to Polly S.
  Massey, daughter of Jordan Massey, who came from North Carolina a few years
  before. They lived together to raise a family of six children to be grown,
  until 3rd December, 1870 when our mother died in the triumph of the Christian
  faith. Our father's life was one of spirituality, temperance, industry,
  truthfulness and honesty. He kept steadily in view the Golden Rule, &quot;Do
  unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot;, and his benevolent
  disposition was continually tested by his preference always to receive than to
  give offense. As a public man he always manifested a lively cheerful and
  lenient temper, in manners he was firm, steady and retiring, and in habits he
  was a hard working man, prompt in all his dealings with his fellow man and
  strove to give satisfaction. In early life he was a Baptist in belief, but
  many years before his death he believed and upheld the doctrine of the
  Methodist church, and although he never attached himself to any church, yet he
  abstained from committing the many gross sins common to others. He used no
  profanity or obscene language; abstained from deceitfulness hypocrisy,
  selfishness, covetousness, or narrow mindedness, and accorded all men their
  just due politically, religiously, or financially.</i></p>
  <p><i>He was of a nature too generous to
  accumulate wealth, and though he boasted of only a few of this worlds goods,
  yet he could have boasted of a fortune in the highest place based upon his
  character with all who knew him. Everybody was his friend. Enemies he had
  none. As a citizen he was a &quot;model man&quot;, and to all appearances he
  was a Christian; he was a constant reader of the Bible for thirty years or
  more; he did not, however profess to have made his peace with his maker until
  a short time before his<br>
  death when he averred his confidence in the mercy and goodness of God and his
  resignation to his will, saying that he was willing to die when it was the
  pleasure of the Lord for him to do so. He was sick eight weeks, confined to
  his bed for five the two last of which he suffered intensely, but bore it with
  patience and Christian fortitude, and on the turning of 18th March 1881 at
  9:20 he breathed his last without a struggle, groan or movement of a muscle,
  Thus passed, quietly away an affectionate father, a<br>
  loving husband, a trusted friend and good citizen.</i></p>
  <p><i>His remains were interred by the side of our
  mother, his wife at the family burying ground on Shoals Creek, Giles County,
  Tennessee.<br>
  <br>
  I was at my father's bedside when soul and body were separated. Sad were my
  thoughts and gloomy were my feelings, as the facts presented themselves that
  &quot;the last link&quot; was broken that once bound our happy family
  together. Mother gone! Father gone, as we confidently trust, to the abode of
  the blessed, whilst we; their children are scattered, some in one state and
  some in another, never to be re-united on earth. But, let us in our
  bereavement take comfort from the Christian's hope that we will someday be
  together again in this blissful eternity, if we obey the mandates of our Lord
  and Savior Jesus Christ.</i></p>
