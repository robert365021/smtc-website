  From the above map we see the Brown (Davis) Cemetery GPS location a couple of 
miles east of Hwy 31. <br>

  <b>Location: </b><b>
Highway 31 south from Pulaski to Hardy Rd (at 
Ephesus Church of Christ on the left) turn left and go 1 1/2 miles, get out and climb up 
the gentle slope and into the woods. Once you reach an old fence row the cemetery will 
be further north behind that about 70 yards continuing in the woods. You will be unable to 
find this cemetery when the trees are leafed. The leaves will block your 
vision and cut your visibility to about a few feet. To help on visibility visit here 
during the winter time. It is my opinion the GPS readings above may have enough 
error that you will have difficulty finding this cemetery using a hand help 
navigator. I found 
that every map I used calculated a little difference in the reading. I plotted the 
GPS from the site but that does not have consistency either. The GPS on Delorme 
maps I was showing plotted a place 200 years southeast from the cemetery in 
a rocky ditch. Therefore I abandoned that and went westward and north to finally 
locate 
the cemetery.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows the Cemetery plotted about where I believe the cemetery resides. 
If there is error in this the plotting the cemetery is further north than the 
place plotted above. I roamed around so much in my attempts to find this 
cemetery that I lost my relative position and could not prove it using GPS 
readings that were inconsistent anyway. I think the problem is errors in the 
maps not in the GPS. There is no clear right of way to this cemetery and the 
cemetery blends in with the surrounding woodland leaving it hard to locate.<br>
