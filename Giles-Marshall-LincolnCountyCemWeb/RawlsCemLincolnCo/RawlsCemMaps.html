Location: From 
Fayetteville go south on Hwy 231 and turn right on Molino Rd. (before the Hwy 
110 turn off also to the right). Follow Molino Rd more than 5 miles and turn 
south (left) on Red Hill Road. Go a few hundred yards and turn (with 
permission/notification) right (west) into the driveway of two homes and the 
cemetery is on the left side of the driveway of the home on the right under the 
trees on a rise.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

There is a new home being built just north of the cemetery and by now is 
completed, but the same roads as shown above still apply. Mr Boxer Bulldog will 
greet you from the house on the left with lots of noisy barking and rushing 
toward you, but it my experience was, he really doesn't want trouble in the end 
as long as you stay away from his home. See Mr. Boxer Bulldog on the front page. 
Maybe the owners won't trade him in for a Pit bulldog. HA!<br>
