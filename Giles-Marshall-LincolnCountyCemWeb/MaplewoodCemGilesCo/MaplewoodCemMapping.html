To get to the old part of the cemetery from Pulaski on E. College St - go south 
on South Rhodes St. and the cemetery is on your left. To get to the new section 
of the cemetery instead go south on Ballentine St and look to your right. Find 
the cemetery locations as specified in this site. The office can direct you to a 
specific grave if you cannot decipher the plot location on this site. The office 
is located on S. Sam Davis Ave. or accessible 
also from Cleveland Street.<br>
