FOLLIS, David Benjamin<br>
FOLLIS, David Benjamin The Pulaski Citizen 24 Mar 1910<br>
David Benjamin Follis died Saturday afternoon at St. Thomas Hospital in 
Nashville, where he had undergone an operation for appendicitis Thursday. His 
case was a desperate one from the first, but his many friends here and in 
Nashville hoped for the best.<br>
The burial was at Maplewood Cemetery Sunday afternoon from the Methodist Church, 
after an impressive funeral service by Rev. G. A. Morgan. There was a great 
concourse of friends of the family, and the deceased young man, and a wealth of 
floral tributes.<br>
Ben Follis was twenty years and two months of age, and had been with the 
International Harvester Company since he was sixteen years old, first completing 
a business college course. He was book keeper for the company for a while and 
was then promoted to advertising manager and assistant to the General Manager. 
If he had been a year older he could have been promoted to one of the most 
responsible and best paying positions within the company's gift.<br>
Ben stood high in the confidence and esteem of his employers and associates and 
all speak in the highest terms of him besides attesting in many ways their 
respect for him and their sorrow and sympathy on account of his unexpected death 
at the very threshold of a bright and successful life. He became early in life 
identified as a faithful member of Mt. Olivet Methodist Church and Sunday 
School, near Riversburg. He was always a steady sober minded, noble, sensible 
boy with a sufficient amount of wholesome good humor and liveliness about him. 
The follies of life which tempt so many boys and young men, did not appeal to 
him.<br>
Ben retained consciousness almost to the very last minute and half an hour 
before his death introduced his father to his nurse and a number of his friends 
who were standing sorrowfully by. He spoke of his boyhood days at Buford and 
told his father he wished they were there now. He expressed himself a perfectly 
resigned to his end which he met peacefully.<br>
This is the first death to occur in Trustee Follis' family and its grief is 
unusually sad and bitter as the genial Trustee's family is a most devoted one.<br>
The Citizen joins the community in sincere sympathy and also on behalf of 
Trustee Follis and family conveys their heartfelt thanks to friends here and in 
Nashville for acts of sympathetic kindness. <br>
