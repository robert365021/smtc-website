16 Jul 1924<br>
Andrew L. King, aged about 75 years, died at his home in Pulaski after an 
illness of about two weeks, affecting the lungs and heart, and supposed to have 
been brought on by taking cold. Rev. J. R. Parsons and Dr. M. S. Kennedy 
conducted the funeral services Friday afternoon and the interment was in the 
family vault at Maplewood Cemetery.<br>
Mr. King began his business career at Elkton as a young man nearly fifty years 
ago, later coming to Pulaski where he and the late T. E. Daly were together in 
business several years.<br>
Since then Mr. King has been actively and prominently identified with the 
business interests of the town being senior member of the firm of King and 
Flournoy at the time of his death. Mr. King was a man of fine business 
qualifications and great energy. He was a trustee of the Methodist Church and 
for many years a steward. He was on of the Board of Trust of Martin College, and 
had occupied other positions of trust, which he always filled faithfully and 
well, among them, the vice presidency of the Peoples Bank. In addition, he owned 
extensive farm interests which he managed and directed in a most efficient 
manner. He was public spirited and a man with numerous acts of kindness and 
quiet generosity to his credit, and in his death the business interests of the 
town and county have suffered a severe loss, the community one of its best 
citizens and his family a kind and indulgent husband, father and brother.<br>
Surviving Mr. King are his wife, one daughter, Mrs. Stokley Nelson and a 
brother, Lewis King of Nashville, who have the sympathy of their many friends.<br>
