AYMETT, Annie E. Harwell<br>
The Pulaski Citizen, Jan 21, 1904. Mrs. John M. Aymett died in Nashville, 
thursday, Jan. 14, just as the evening sun was sinking behind the western hills, 
the spirit of Mrs. John M. Aymett took its flight from Douglass' Infirmary, 
Nashville, where she had gone for treatment. And loved ones who watched beside 
her experienced that peculaiarly panful sense of loneliness and desolate 
separation from mother and companion which is known only to those who have been 
called upon to pass through a similiar ordeal. Mrs. John M. Aymett was the 
daughter of Rev. Logan Harwell, a Methodist preacher, and having been raised to 
love the church, she became a member in early girlhood and lived a consistent 
Christian life. In the dawn of young womanhood she was married to John M. Aymett 
with whom she lived happily till her untimely death. Two children were born to 
the, a son who died when a small boy, and a daughter, Mrs. A. Loyd. Mrs Aymett 
had been in feeble health for two or three years, but as she was not given to 
complaining, many intimate friends did not know how serious was her condition. 
As a last resort she submitted patiently to an operation which the doctors said 
offered the only hope and that was slight. She came out from the influence of 
ether and lived two days, retaining consciousness to the last. The body was 
brought back here and taken to the home of J. A. Loyd where it was viewed by a 
large concourse of friends and neighbors by whom Mrs. Aymett was so greatly 
loved. She was of a quiet retiring disposition devoting her life and energies 
largely to the welfare and happiness of others. And perhaps no one in the county 
was more generally loved. The funeral was conducted at the Methodist Church by 
Rev. J. W. Cherry and Rev. H. B. Reams, then the body was laid to rest in 
Maplewood.<br>

* ABERNATHY, Ruffin, <br>
Ruff (Ruffin) Abernathy, (b. 1845; d. 26 Jul. 1926) fought in the Civil War 
along with his owner Tom Abernathy, and received a pension. According to the 
information submitted to the Tennessee Board of Pension Examiners, Ruffin 
Abernathy was a cook, serving in the 3rd Tennessee Volunteer Infantry Regiment 
under Captain Flavel C. Barber, in the Confederate army of 1863. Captain Barber 
was killed in the battle of Resaca, Georgia. Ruffin was then taken in charge of 
by Surgeon General Samuel H. Stout of the Confederate army and placed as servant 
in the Distributing Hospital at Atlanta, Georgia. When Generals Hood and Sherman 
fought the battle of Atlanta in 1864, Surgeon General Stout moved him from 
Atlanta hospital to the hospital at Lisonia, Alabama. After this fight, Surgeon 
General Stout took him back to or near Atlanta, Georgia in 1865. Later General 
Lee surrendered and as Rebel soldiers were coming in every day, General Stout 
was about to be discharged, so he called him from the Distributing Hospital near 
Atlanta to the discharging office and he took the oath at the same time of 
General Stout. &quot;Then and there&quot; they left the army together and General Stout 
took him back to his old home where he was taken from at the beginning of the 
war. He received an honorable discharge. <br>

* ADAMS, John, Civil War Confederate Brigadier General. The son of Irish 
immigrants, he entered the United States Military Academy in 1841, graduating 
25th in his class. Commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Dragoons-United 
States Regular Army, he served under Captain Philip Kearny in the Mexican War. 
On March 16, 1848, he was brevetted for gallantry and meritorious conduct at the 
Battle of Santa Cruz de Rosales and in 1851 was commissioned 1st Lieutenant. 
Promotion to Captain followed in 1856. Except for 2 years as a recruiting 
officer, he completed his United States Army career on frontier duty at Fort 
Crook, California, where he resigned on May 31, 1861. He traveled to New York 
City, where he learned that General Winfield Scott had ordered the arrest of 
Regular Army officers suspected of resigning to join the Confederacy. Evading 
capture, he went to Tennessee, enlisted in the Confederate army as a Captain of 
Cavalry, and was placed in command at Memphis. By May 1862 he had advanced to 
Colonel and by December to Brigadier General, assuming command of Brigadier 
General Lloyd Tilghman's Mississippi infantry brigade after Tilghman's death in 
May 1863. He served under General Joseph E. Johnston during the campaign to 
relieve Vicksburg, then joined Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk in Mississippi, 
marching with him to Resaca, Georgia, where he was transferred to the Army of 
Tennessee. His brigade served in the advance during most of General John B. 
Hood's campaign to force Major General William T. Sherman northward after the 
fall of Atlanta, and he received commendation for his valiant service. He 
remained with Hood during the Franklin and Nashville Campaign, serving briefly 
under Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest. He was severely wounded in the right 
arm early in the Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864, but refused to leave the 
field. Later that day he was killed leading his regiment in a determined but 
unsuccessful assault on the Union lines. He was one of six Confederate Generals 
killed during the battle. <br>

* BRAMLETT, Judge Lunsford Meredith Bramlett, He was born about 1780 in North Carolina. He 
married Sarah Slater in Williamson County Tennessee on June 29 1815. After her 
death he married Mary Crockett on Sept 14, 1848.<br>
Sketches of the Bench and Bar of Tennessee by Joshua William Caldwell<br>
Among the Tennesseans of former times who were once prominent, who performed 
valuable public service, and whose names are all but unknown to the present 
generation, is Lunsford M. Bramlett.<br>
He was, like many others whose names belong to our history, a native of North 
Carolina. He was born in Surry County, but exactly when, it is impossible to 
say. Conflicting accounts of the descent of his father are given, some saying 
that he was of English origin, and others that he was of Huguenot or 
Scotch-Irish stock. It is certain that his mother was of the Virginia family of 
Taylors, and was remotely akin to Zachary Taylor.<br>
The future Chancellor probably was born in the last decade of the last century. 
It appears that soon after his birth the family went to Wilkes County Georgia, 
where he was reared. In 1813 he came to Tennessee, and on march 7, 1814, was 
admitted to the bar at Pulaski. He was a diligent and persevering student of the 
law, zealous in behalf of his clients and more than ordinarily prone to enter 
into their feelings. That he was a successful lawyer, and was esteemed by the 
public and by the profession, is proved by his elevation to the bench at a time 
when judicial office was carefully bestowed. He became Chancellor in 1836, and 
served until 1844, He died in 1854. After retiring from the bench he endured the 
hard fortune that waits on retired Judges, and was unable to regain his 
practice. <br>
In his life he was devoted to the law, and after his death the settlement of his 
estate seems to have occupied surviving members of the profession for some time.<br>
As Chancellor he was distinguished not for brilliancy or readiness of decision, 
bur for careful and conscientious investigation, and an earnest desire to be 
just. At the bar he was not an eloquent speaker, but a painstaking and zealous 
advocate, who by fair means made the best of every case.<br>
This is the record, not of a great man, but of an excellent and worthy one, a 
good lawyer, and a competent and upright Judge.<br>
The Goodspeed History of Wilson County, Tennessee<br>
The Chancery Court of Wilson County convened for the first time July 25, 1836, 
at the court house in Lebanon, the Chancery Court of the State having been 
created during that year, having been provided for by the Constitutional 
Convention of 1834. Hon. Lunsford M. Bramlett was the presiding chancellor, and 
John H. Dew was appointed clerk and master. <br>

morning about 3 o'clock, the house where he was boarding burned, and a telegram 
received here later in the day brought the sad news that his body had been found 
among the ruins. Jim and Walter Bunch, two older brothers, went on the first 
train, and brought the remains to Pulaski for burial. Funeral services were 
conducted Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock from the home of Will Bunch, another 
brother.<br>
Otis was 19 years and 7 months old, and had lived a quiet studious, industrious 
life.<br>
The Birmingham Age Herald of Monday gives the following report of the 
unfortunate occurrence: In the smoking ruins of the home of J. T. Fox, at Ensley 
the mutilated remains of Otis Bunch, a young electrician, were found yesterday 
morning shortly after daylight. . . the body was lying beside a wrecked piano, 
where it had fallen from the room above when the floor gave way to the flames. . 
. The house which was destroyed was a ten room structure . . . and was occupied 
by Mr. Fox and family, who conducted a boarding house. Eighteen young men roomed 
at the house and all were asleep when the house was discovered ablaze. By 
leaping from upper story windows in their night clothes all of the young men 
escaped except young Bunch. Several of them sustained slight injuries and lost 
all their belongings. . When the inmates of the house had gotten together it was 
found that young Bunch, who is only nineteen years of age, was missing. . . 
suspicion was aroused as to how he came to his death. . . The Ensley police are 
investigating the matter . . .The theory is advanced that young Bunch was 
murdered and the house set on fire to hide the crime. No alarm was turned in 
until the structure was almost consumed. Otis Bunch came to Ensley from Pulaski, 
Tennessee, several months ago and secured a position in the Ensley steel mills 
as an electrician. He was paid a big salary in full Saturday, but none of his 
money had been found, though it is possible it was burned in the fire. The 
entire affair is enveloped in mystery and the city attorney and police are 
working hard to solve it. No direct charges have been made against any 
individual, but on account of the horrible mutilation of the boy's body the 
authorities deemed an investigation necessary. The remains sent to Pulaski, 
Tennessee. The funeral services will be held tomorrow.<br>
