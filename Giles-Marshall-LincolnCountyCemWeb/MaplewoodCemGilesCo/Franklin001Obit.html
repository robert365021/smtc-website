1807 - 2 Jun 1897, Pulaski Giles Co Tn. Maplewood Cemetery (according to the 
Obit.. Pulaski Tennessee where he is interred and has a write up.<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Mr. Benjamin (Dunn) Franklin, 
one of Giles County's oldest and most respected citizens died at the home of his 
daughter, Mrs. J. E. Matthews, Wednesday, June 2, at 10:30 a.m. in the 91st year 
of his age.<br>
He was born in eastern Georgia, Jan. 1, 1807, and came to Tennessee with his 
grandfather, Abraham Franklin, in 1818. His first wife was Miss Francis 
(Dorothy) Lee. His second wife was Miss America Jones who died in 1875. There 
were no children of his last marriage.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
His surviving children are Mrs. Sarah Ann (David Lanier) Graves, of Neosho, MO.; 
Mrs. N(ewton). G(reene). Eslick (interred in New Zion Cemetery) and Mrs. J. E. 
Matthews, of and near this place. He was a life-long Methodist and an old line 
Whig. <br>
<br>
After funeral services at the residence by Rev. Marion Kennedy, the remains were 
interred in Maplewood.&quot;<br>

resurrect this. I could not tell italics from non-italics)<br>

Information was also obtained from family files located in Giles County 
Historical Society records, Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee, USA.<br>
<br>
This Ben Franklin family was Family #794 in Dist 10 of Giles County 1860. This 
was next door to the Samuel family who were Family #795. There is an old 
unmarked Franklin Cemetery just west of Fire-tower Road back in the woods with 
stones without any inscription. Since my efforts to find more of this family 
listed in graveyards of Giles County have failed I have to concluded they are 
buried in this lost Franklin cemetery in unmarked graves. Perhaps buried there 
are the children of Ben &amp; Sarah Franklin that died in their home in Dist 10 
along with possible earlier generations such as the grandfather and parents 
mentioned below. Statement says that Ben came to Giles Co with his grandfather 
Abraham Franklin not mentioning the parents.<br>
