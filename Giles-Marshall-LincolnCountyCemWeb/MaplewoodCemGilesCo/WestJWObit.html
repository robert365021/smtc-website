Oct 1924<br>
John W. West, aged a few weeks past 90 years died Sunday at his home in the 
eastern suburbs of Pulaski of the infirmities of age, after an honorable and 
useful career. His burial was at Maplewood Cemetery with the rites of the 
Masonic fraternity with which he had long been identified. He also was a member 
of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.<br>
Mr. West was at one time a Justice of the Peace here. He was a fine mechanic and 
worked on until a few years ago when advancing age forced him to give up the 
activities of life.<br>
His wife died a number of years ago. Surviving him are his sons, Sam and Carson 
West, and a daughter, Mrs. A. M. Weatherford.<br>
