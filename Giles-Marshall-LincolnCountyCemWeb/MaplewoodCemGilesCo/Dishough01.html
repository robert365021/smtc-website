<p class="MsoNormal"><b>They were living on 4th 
Street. When I first moved to Pulaski, I remember seeing this old man, Tom 
Pittman riding all over town on a bicycle. He wore a burlap sack around his neck 
and went all over town gathering up cardboard. He would fill up an old garage at 
his home with the cardboard and when it was about full the City Workers would go 
and haul it off and he would fill it up again. This is the Thomas A. Pittman who 
was her grandson. I guess when she died he just didn�t put up a marker for her.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What do you think about 
putting her on the gravesite with the others and put unmarked grave? I am going 
to use her other name Arena. (By Jean Cosby, 2014)</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>There is still one of the 
four sides of that Dishongh Monument that has not been photographed by the 
Findagrave people. I remember running by that monument  in a hurry to max my day 
and skipped it because there was only one stone inside a fence. Either the 
fourth (Plaque) side has nothing on it or perhaps it may have her name listed. 
That is a perfect situation for an unmarked grave.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>I looked in the Cemetery 
book to see if it was in the index but there are no Dishongh or any version of 
spelling that name so they either missed the whole stone or left it out of the 
index. Not in Findagrave so I'd say yea go for it - a new listing unmarked in 
Lot 85 b. 1836 d. between 1910 and 1920 assuming you did not find her in 1920 
and I did not. She is in the 1900 Census as Irene but shows a funny age of 57 - 
b. 1843 so ignore that because the other census say 1836.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#000080" size="2">Yea, she far outlived her 
family so she is in Maplewood Cem without an inscription. Not much doubt. Can 
you make up a listing and we will put her there. I just don't believe she was 
born in 1810. BTW the census is consistent on her age as 1860 - 24 or 1836 
1910   74 as 1836 so she died after 1910 not being in the 1920 census.</font></b></p>

these listings for a start - correcting/finishing up as you can:</b></p>
