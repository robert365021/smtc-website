Location: Go Hwy 31S about 15 miles to Elkton, right on Hwy 273 (Elkton to 
Prospect Road), cross Richland Creek, turn left and go about a 1/2 mile on 
Wright/Kelly Road. Just before the road ends in dirt turn right between the 
trees on a long driveway to a home. The home in front of you is occupied and 
requires permission. The cemetery is in back of house in a grove of old Cedar 
Trees.<br>
I went to this home looking for this cemetery. When I arrived three big dogs 
greeted me. They were a Pit Bull, a German Police and a mixed mutt. I was very 
wary of them knowing their vicious reputation. So I sat a spell in the truck 
with the windows rolled up and no one came to the door. I heard a vacuum cleaner 
though so knew someone was home. At this point I recognized the cemetery in 
back of the house and knew I had the location correct. I noticed the dogs were 
not barking so I rolled the window down just slightly and stuck my hand out 
partially. The Pit Bull came up and got close without showing any agitation so I 
reached out slowly and petted his head. He was satisfied and moved away. That 
was one greeting down, and two more to go. The German Police moved up close to 
the truck and I slowly repeated the process. Wow that was too easy. The third 
dog hung back in submission since the other dogs were likely alpha males. They 
were older dogs, well cared for and well fed and not used to strangers with 
a friendly disposition. At that point I got out of the truck and trusted them as 
being lovable mutts. Such is the nature of a dog where their guard skills are 
rarely tested and aging. Then there were two horses also vying for attention. Lucky for me there was a fence between them and me. A lady was home and granted 
me permission to do the survey, so my thanks to her. As a rule I don't reveal 
names without permission.<br>
