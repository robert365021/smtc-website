This is Minnie Warren Owens. When she died her husband built the slab over her 
grave so the rain wouldn't get to her remains. This picture was taken when Linda 
Jo Hendrix Dean and I (Sue Davis) visited the cemetery. Something had broke her 
tombstone. <a href="MinnieWarrenOwensagain.jpg">Photo2</a><br>

</font>First time of the two visits I 
(Sue) 
made to this cemetery I thought the Appleton rocks were very pretty marble 
stones. The last time I went something had pawed in the Owens grave, Probably a 
horse pawing it. [Sue Davis, year 31 Jul 2000.]<br>
Sue Hendrix Davis and Linda Jo Hendrix Dean read the Owen Cemetery on 31 July 2000. 
Larry Harrison drove his tractor to the cemetery, and we followed in a four 
wheel drive truck through the creek, mud holes, fields and up a hill close to 
the Devil�s Backbone. (Devils Backbone center at GPS: N 35.04282 W 87.23183). 
The Owens cemetery was located on this same hill. We were able to drive the 
truck right up to the cemetery, and didn�t have to climb any fences or go 
through any briar patches. All graves of the Owens family members had mummy 
shaped stone vaults on top of the ground. One vault had apparently been 
repaired. Sue had been to the cemetery years before and said this particular 
vault had pieces broken off as if something hard had hit or pawed it. There 
wasn�t any writing on it. <br>
The story handed down through the years is that John Robert Owens made all these 
stone vaults himself, being an adept stone carver. [Sue Davis, year 2000]<br>
