This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Owens Cemetery.
This is south east of Lawrenceburg near the Giles County line. The GPS as calculated by C. Wayne Austin: 
N 35.03654 W -87.22969.<br/>

</b><b>Location: Go South from Lawrenceburg on Hwy. #43 to 
Leoma, turn left on Rabbit 
Trail <br/>
Rd., (Hwy 98) and again left (or east on Hood Hollow Road. Follow that for about 
3 &amp; 1/2 miles to Appleton, turn or merge left onto Appleton Road and go about a 
mile passing the junction of Blooming grove road along the way. Next the road 
bends back left (north) again and the Dobbins Cemetery will be on your right. 
Continue north about a 1/2 mile to the </b><b>
West Fork Creek (of sugar creek) <br/>
and Sugar Creek. Cross the Creek (with permission) and turn left (west) and go 
(walk) about 3/4 mile along the edge of an open field which can follow the West 
Fork Creek if you wish. Climb the hill and find the cemetery in a grove of trees 
at the top. After you reach the top of the hill on the field road the cemetery 
is nearby.<br/>
Sadly I have been informed that Mr. Harrison who showed this cemetery to the Sue 
&amp; Linda has passed away. Sue was told the new owner wants to close off the road 
after Dobbins Cemetery and he said no one would be allowed to cross his land. 
How ugly can people be. Its hard enough to get to this cemetery having to ford a 
creek and climb a hill nearly a mile away, much less a land owner with a bad 
attitude toward visitors who wish him no harm and will probably only ask for a 
survey about once every 10 years.<br/>
