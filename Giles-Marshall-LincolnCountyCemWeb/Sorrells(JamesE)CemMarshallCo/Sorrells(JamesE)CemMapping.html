Location: From Fayetteville go north many miles on Highway 231 to Chestnut Ridge 
and turn left on Hwy 129 (Chestnut Ridge/Petersburg Rd). Follow that about 3 
miles and turn right (north) on Bledsoe Road and go something under three miles 
and turn left on Hannah Gap Road. The Hannah Gap Baptist Church is on your right 
just before you turn left. Follow Hannah Gap Road which becomes Sorrells Road 
after crossing into Marshall County for 2+ miles and and look to the left where 
you will see the tall stones of the Sorrells family.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery outlined in yellow next to the road on the 
(left) south side. The cemetery is maintained by the Sorrells family with 
fencing on three sides.<br>

The Jake Sorrells family and home. May have been across the road from the 
cemetery.<br>

From this google image we see surviving parts of an old home which shows the 
foundation rocks and the chimney. This sits back in the field south east of the 
JE Sorrells Cemetery about 150 yards. There is a problem matching this chimney 
which looks similar to the one in the home above in that the chimney sites 
inside the home in this building and the one above for the JE Sorrells home is 
on the side. This home may have belonged to the Elzey family which has a family 
graveyard another 200 yards up the hill to the southeast.<br>
