  Take the southern (Hwy 64) Bypass for 
	Pulaski going west Go past Hwy 31 past Hwy 166 &amp; Hwy 11. Next go about 1 &amp; 
	1/2 miles further and turn left (west) on Chicken Creek Road. Go 7 tenths of 
	a mile and look left at a field road into the Rocky Point Cemetery. Go 75 
	yards to the gate and with permission thru it into the open field and before 
	you reach the Rocky Point cemetery gate across the way bear south (right) 
	and go up the slope along the outside fence line of the Rocky Point Cemetery 
	to the end of that cemetery. Next continuing in the same direction go 
	another 50 yards further and turn 90 
	degrees and face the tree line. In the wintertime the cemetery can be seen 
	under the trees with the few stones that are still standing.</font><font color="#008000" size="2"><br>
