SPIVY, Julia W., 21 Feb 1843 - 27 Jun 1914. (Could this 
footstone be for Julia, it has no inscription and no headstone could be located. 
It is of the same size and style of the footstone of Mary E. Marks.)

<p>There was only one stone standing in this 
cemetery when I arrived here. It was almost as if someone wanted to diminish the 
fact that this was a cemetery. As I approached the cemetery all I could see was 
fragments of stones. From the distance I thought they were all fieldstones until 
I examined them closely and realized they were broken bases etc. The first stone I found buried was the William T. Marks 
monument, then the Ursula H. stone, then I pitched a tool over in the next row 
and it struck a solid object. From that I discovered and uncovered the stone for the 
daughter Ursula. At this point I realized more lost stones were here so I walked 
the rows looking for others and found the Louis T. &amp; Louis P Marks Monuments. 
They were in good shape but had fallen and needed only to be set back up. They 
had good bases. The Louis P. Marks stone is a new find having never before been 
reported. I have also listed the fieldstone as for that of John Marks though I have no 
complete evidence the stone I found south beside Ursula b. 1814 was really his.

<br>
1870 census of Giles County, Civil Dist 6, Pulaski Post Office (The civil&nbsp; 
District and Post Office seem to be a match for where this graveyard is 
located):<br>
Marks, John, Age 63, farmer, born in Virginia value of property $5,000<br>
Marks, Sarah, Age 57, keeps house (Ursula?)<br>
Marks, Della, Age 20, in house<br>
Marks, Jones, Age 17, works on farm<br>
I did not find any of this family in the 1872 D. G. Beers Census of property 
owners. Either that is incorrect, I missed them due to the faint writing or the 
heirs sold out because of death of John &amp; Ursula.&nbsp; <br>
This is civil Dist 6 &amp; the Pulaski Post Office of about 1870 and I believe those 
are a match being about 3 miles SW of original downtown Pulaski. <br>
If this census record &amp; D.G. Beers census of 1872 is not a match to the Marks in 
this cemetery then I don't know the approximate birth &amp; death dates of John 
Marks. C.W.A.<br>
We solicit your input if you have better info on the folks in this graveyard.&nbsp;
