Location: From Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64 several miles to Hwy 273 aka Old 
Elkton Pike and turn left. Follow that to Swan Creek Road on your right and go 
behind the first house after you pass Swan Creek Road. The inhabitants of that 
home lease the property which actually belongs to the Wilson family who lives 
nearby.<br>

This pictorial view from Google shows the cemetery on the north side of the road 
marked with a yellow pointer. How bout that Chic-fil-lay advertisement specimen 
on our left.<br>
