The Footstone for Bettie Orr. As you can see the inscribed initials had to be
uncovered from the earth.<br>

Footstone is mostly all that remains. Folks this is the work of a vandal. A
tree falling on a stone will not cause random scattering and missing pieces that
I found here. I can only make out &quot;Bettie&quot; &quot;Born N _ _&nbsp; 10,
1_ _ _, DIED _ _ _ 1, 188_.&quot; There is a fragment with the Mason symbol that
is probably part of another missing &amp; broken memorial. I left this
collection near the Vincent
memorials. There were stone fragments found all over this cemetery, but
many of them were eroded and unreadable.&nbsp;<br>
