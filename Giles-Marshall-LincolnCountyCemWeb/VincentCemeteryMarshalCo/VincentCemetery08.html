Footstones are mostly all that remains here. Folks this is the work of a vandal,
also known as the &quot;Scum of the Earth.&quot; A tree falling on a stone will
not cause widespread random scattering and missing pieces of stone that I found
here. The works of a Vandal generally manifest itself this way. First they take
stones and smash them together and break as many as they can. Next they engage
in a throwing party, scattering the fragments around causing actually more
damage than breaking them, since epoxy glue can repair them if found.<br>
