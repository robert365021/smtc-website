The stone with the arrow pointing downward has no top that is easily found so it
is missing from this listing I presume.<br>

<font size="2"><b>ORR, Unknown stone in the Orr Area fallen and the top is
missing with the inscription.<br>
At first glance one could wrongly conclude the base belongs to the Minerva Orr
memorial shown flat on the ground. However, the base for that stone can be seen
just in front of her memorial between us and and her stone. If I had probed the
area the missing top might could have been located. The subject stone base is
identical to that of Thomas Orr an almost sure sign it belongs to that family.
Also the Minerva Orr memorial footstone can be seen as the small white round top
marker out a ways which is still standing. The tall dark memorial on our right
is the Thomas Orr Memorial dug from the ground. It was buried and flat on its
face with the inscription down and was necessary to upright it to read it.</b></font><i><b><font size="2"><br>
