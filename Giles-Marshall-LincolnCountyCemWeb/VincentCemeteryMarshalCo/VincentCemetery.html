</font><font color="#800080"><b><font size="2">Fred Hawkins directions 1987: On
same ridge, and within sight of McKnight Cemetery. However, it<br>
is necessary to cross the fence into Mr. Emmett Kennon's<br>
place.<br>
2008 directions: From I-65 take Exit 32 toward Mooresville 2 tenths of a mile
and turn right (North) onto Gupton Road. Go about 1 1/4 mile north on Gupton
Road and look left and there will be a Fence Row going away from the Road (west)
leading first down into a hollow and continuing up a sharp hill to a ridge. The
cemetery is to the right (north) of that fence Row upon the top of that
ridge&nbsp; among a stand of Trees (mostly Cedar). That is a distance of about
250 yards west of Gupton Road.</font></b></font></font></p>

Sadly this cemetery has been nearly destroyed by Vandals since it was last
transcribed. Not a single stone was found standing
when I arrived. Only two of the inscriptions could be read complete without 
digging and putting broken peices together. I managed to upright
the Thomas Orr memorial while there and it was OK due to being buried beneath
the soil (lost to the vandals.)&nbsp;<br>
 The largest monument, a one ton modern gray granite
memorial, was toppled on its face by a large tree trunk pushing up against the base
rendering it out of level. Couple that with cattle rubbing against it to appease
their itching and it fell off its base onto its face. The stone weighs as much
as a ton so no one can raise it without equipment. It is the Vincent memorial
and I was unable to confirm the
inscription for J. A. &amp; Martha Vincent. Unless Marshall County translators
did so Mr. Fred Hawkins was the last
person during 1987 to read &amp; publish the inscription so we are relying on
him or even prior to him assuming he was unable to read some of these stones. I
do not know who was the last to read the inscriptions above on upright
stones, but I doubt it has been with the last 20 years. We as citizens should be
outraged to see such destruction to historical cemeteries. The answer is simple.
Document in place and then remove all these cemeteries to a common large
community cemetery and return this land to the farmer.</font></b></font></p>
