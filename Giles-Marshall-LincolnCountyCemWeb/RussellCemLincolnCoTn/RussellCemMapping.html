Location: From 
Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64 nearly to Exit 14 of I-65 in Giles County. 
Turn south (left) on Bradshaw Creek Road. That road becomes Dee Solomon Rd 
after crossing into Lincoln County. When you go a little further it junctions 
with Loyd Road aka Stanford 
Hollow Road. Turn right (west) and with permission go right into the home &amp; farm lane. This  
today is the Story property and you can reach George Story at 615-974-9205 for 
permission to get past the gate to the farm. At the barn follow along the ridge 
going northeast until you get to a sunken pond and the cemetery is another 75 
yards past the pond continuing on an easterly course still in the woodland.&nbsp;<br>
Also the cemetery is 400 yards east, but bearing to the north of the house and 
barn along and up the gentle slope. Another way of measuring it is the cemetery 
is about 2 tenths of a mile northwest of the junction of Dee Solomon Road and Loyd Road. From that point go due northwest across a field (do not damage the 
farmer's fence though) and&nbsp; cross the creek bed. Then continue cross another open field 
and after going into the woods go up the slope about 75 yards and you will see 
the cemetery under two giant Beech Trees among other trees. There are cattle on 
this property and the fences are high so use care here. With permission use can use 
two way ladders for the fences if 
you want to get there using the shortest walking route. The shortest walking 
route is from Dee Solomon Rd. Walk 300 yards along the outside or south side of 
the tree line going southwest and turn right and to into the woodland and go up 
the slope and the 
cemetery is 75 yards into the woodland.</b></font></p>
