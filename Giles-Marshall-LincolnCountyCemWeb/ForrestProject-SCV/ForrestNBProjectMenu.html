possible considering many soldiers died in battle without monuments and should 
be recognized. The blood of these gentleman &amp; women courses gently in our

<b>Some knowledge on converting the various methods 
of depicting a GPS reading. Take a 
typical reading such as this: N 35.29.48 by W.86.54.30. First convert it to 
this format: [ N 35 29' 48&quot;, W 86 54' 30&quot;&nbsp; ]. This makes ACME Mapper 2.0 and 
other GPS programs work for you to find for example Joe Gipson's grave shown 
here. However if you are 
running the ACME Mapper program in decimal mode (the most detailed format) do this to convert 
over: Operate on each numeral separately - from right to left - first use N 
(north) number and start on the 48 (of 35 29 48) and&nbsp; divide the 48/60 = .800 then add the 29 
and .8 to get 29.80. Next divide that 29.80 by 60 to equal .49667. Next&nbsp; add the 
result to the 35 to become 35.49667. That is the Latitude completed. Now do the W 
(west) or longitude by dividing the 30 
by 60 and adding the result to the 54 to become 54.50. Now divide that 54.50/60 
to get .908333 and add this to the 86 to get 86.90833. Don't forget in some 
programs you must add a 
minus sign before the longitude or you will land somewhere in China. The final result 
is 35.49667 X -86.908333. This decimal format is the best one for accuracy as it 
takes you to within about 5 feet of the exact spot assuming there are no 
distortions in your satellite signal. You math whizzes can now see that to 
convert by going the other way one would just multiply by 60 and separate the 
result from the decimal 
for each of the three fields of each of the Lat. &amp; Long. codes. (C. Wayne Austin 23 Oct 2013.)</b></p>
