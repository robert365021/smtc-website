<p>Very old graves outlined in stones- may have been 
part of a vault: <a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/CunninghamCem1LincolnCo/IMG_6522.JPG">6522</a>/<a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/CunninghamCem1LincolnCo/IMG_6521.JPG">6521</a>/<a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/CunninghamCem1LincolnCo/IMG_6536.JPG">6536</a>
<br/>
Large piles of rocks some formed. Might have formed a informal vault at one 
time before tumbling or these could also have been part of the rock fence.

					Photographed on a cloudy Thursday 14 Apr 2016. The 
					inscriptions were updated with exceptions found or known by 
					C. Wayne Austin. This publication culminated from various 
					sources.  
				Listed on page 200-201 of the book Lincoln County County Cemeteries 
				by Tim &amp; Helen Marsh, abt 1978. Added here 30 Apr 2016. We 
					were able to reconstruct the inscription of Emma Florence 
					Thornton for the first time ever, but found  very 
					little of much of the remains of this cemetery. It has been 
					demolished for many years by neglect. Hope this site can 
					continue to serve as the truth of who is buried where.</i></b></p>
