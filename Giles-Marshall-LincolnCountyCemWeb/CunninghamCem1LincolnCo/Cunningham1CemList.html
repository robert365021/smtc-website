part of a vault: <a href="IMG_6522.JPG">6522</a>/<a href="IMG_6521.JPG">6521</a>/<a href="IMG_6536.JPG">6536</a>

Large piles of rocks some formed. Might have formed a informal vault at one 
time before tumbling or these could also have been part of the rock fence.

					little of much of the remains of this cemetery. It has been 
					demolished for many years by neglect. Hope this site can
