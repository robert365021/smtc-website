Location: From 
Fayetteville go south on Hwy 231 and turn left on Ardmore Hwy (110) and follow 
that to McMillan Spur (nearly in Kirkland) which become Camargo Rd. Go abt 1 1/2 
miles and turn left on Yukon Rd. Travel then about 500 yards and you must 
negotiate with the neighbors to find this cemetery using a GPS.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
Basically though Yukon Rd will slightly bend to the right after abt 3 tenths of 
a mile then a little further on begin to bend back to the left. When the road 
bends back left stop &amp; walk due north about 2/3 of a mile along what becomes a 
tree lined hedgerow or fence row. Just before you arrive at the cemetery you 
will cross another fence row spanning east/west. The cemetery is just north of 
that fence row still in the fence row you have been following. Don't forget 
permission and notification of the land owners of your intentions.<br>
