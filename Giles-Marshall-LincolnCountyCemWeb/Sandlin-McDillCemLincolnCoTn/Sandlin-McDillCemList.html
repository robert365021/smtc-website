<b>SANDLIN, Elisabeth</b>, <font color="#800000">-- J-- 1808 - 13 Apr 1816 (fence across her grave, at 
foot of a large Hickory Tree; unable to find this very old grave, nor was the 
Hickory Tree present anymore)</font><br>
<br>
<b>Several graves are here with no markers - 1970s. (Unable to confirm this - 
2013. The whole area has been 
trampled by livestock and a large mud hole existed in the center much like a pig pen. 
Old cow bones were lying all around along with Deer &amp; cattle bones hanging from the 
fence. How disrespectful can you get to a cemetery.</b> <a href="IMG_8379.JPG">8379</a><br>
