<p align="center"><b>DAVIS-MOORE
CEMETERY, (Cornersville Hwy), MARSHALL COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<img border="0" src="Davis-MooreCemTopoMap.jpg" width="929" height="551"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cemetery has never been recorded on any USGS mapping so I
had to make up one here. While I believe this to be the location based on knowing
it was 3 miles south of Lewisburg on the Cornersville Highway and finding it
using Google mapping it is possible I am wrong as I have not visited here. The
GPS coordinates of that location is 35.41147 Degrees North X 86.80374 Degrees
West. &nbsp;<img border="0" src="Davis-MooreCemRoadMap.jpg" width="1009" height="554"><br>
Location: Go three miles south of Lewisville on Cornersville Highway. Cemetery
is next to Hollow Hill Farms on Left side of road, there on the edge of the highway.
A long rock wall surrounds the cemetery.<br>
This author plotted in the Davis Moore Cemetery on the above map using graphics.
It is not listed on the MS Streets Map 2005 Version. I make no absolute claim
the cemetery is located there. The Johnson Cemetery plotted above just south of
there is a separate cemetery and while it is possible the mapping location is
confused with this cemetery it is a separate &amp; known cemetery. <br>
