To get to this cemetery from 
Fayetteville, go out Hwy 64 east toward Winchester. and turn north or left on 
Lynchburg Highway (Hwy 50). follow that highway for 4 or so miles and turn again near the Mulberry Cemetery north on 
Gimlet Road. Follow that to the house just before you get to the Hamestring Rd 
and the cemetery is behind the barn in a field behind an iron fence falling 
down.<br>
