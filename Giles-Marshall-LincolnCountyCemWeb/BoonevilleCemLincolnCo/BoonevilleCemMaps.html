This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Boonville Cemetery.
The nearest major town is Lynchburg in Moore County.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="BoonsvilleCemMapRd.jpg" width="1600" height="778"><br>
Location: Go west east past Mulberry to Boonville Road and take that for several 
miles and Booneville is on your left. Turn into Waggoner Hill Road and go to 
Booneville Cemetery Road and that will take you to this public cemetery.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery with a road about the new part and access to 
the old part. I am confused about the area that recedes back into the woods. 
Ether it is a very old section or it is reserved for the black citizens of the 
area. No matter who is buried there we have included it within these listings, 
though I like to separate the black and white graveyards so that common names 
can be better tied to family members. So if Mamie T. &amp; Jake Reese are your 
relatives and they are black my apologies to you. I can correct this if you will 
make me aware. The back section is mowed separately as if different folks of a 
different stroke are maintaining each section.<br>
