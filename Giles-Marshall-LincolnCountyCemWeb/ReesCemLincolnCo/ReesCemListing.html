<p>I am told by Mr. Russell (age 76 years) who 
has lived up this hollow all his life that there is a Rees Family 
Cemetery for African Americans nearby which is thought to be marked only with 
fieldstones. It is back of Mr. Rees's home who still lives here and may maintain 
this cemetery, which is on a hill behind his house. <br>
<br>
The little spring branch supplying water to the settlers in early times who 
lived in this valley is called Pole Cat Branch. It empties into the West Branch of 
Mulberry Creek right at Charity Road. This branch spans a two mile stretch of 
the valley (hollow) and follows 
Pole Cat Hollow Rd. <b>

Sorry for the clearing tools being in the photos. They were still being used as 
I was making the photography rounds. As I tired it became more difficult to keep 
them from the photo scenes. <br>
The tools were not near as bad as the brush that has overtaken this little 
abandoned cemetery. Folks these were real people that lived and died and are 
buried here long ago and I can tell you they were at least middle class America 
or above during their time.&nbsp; We tend to think when we see an overgrown 
abandoned cemetery that these were the graves of poor lost &amp; forgotten people of 
olden times. I can tell you their characters were generally stronger than ours 
and they certainly could teach us much about survival in our cushy society 
today.&nbsp; Just look as how short their lives were or how many children they 
lost trying to get a family raised. Mothers always dying in child birth or 
related issues. We owe it to them to take better care of their resting places 
than what we are doing, even if private property is involved.&nbsp; Just a 
little single visit and clearing once per year as really about all that is 
needed to sustain this cemetery on a minimal level and that is not enough to 
disturb farming operations. <br>
I could not have made a single readable photo without the first clearing the 
brush from the cemetery for about 2 hours. It is getting to be tough to do, but 
probably, in the long run, makes me stronger and more resilient, but I am 
willing to share the character building with any helpful person.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><i>Added here from photo dated 1 Dec 2011 11:00 to 2:00 PM by C. 
Wayne Austin. Also listed in the book Lincoln County Cemetery Records by Tim &amp; 
Helen Marsh, abt 1963, page 83-84. I believe I may have added about one or two 
listings that were not in that book but the book also contained records that 
were not representative of a transcription of a gravestone, but were in fact 
newspaper death records. This should be the most complete record of this 
cemetery that ever existed, and as these old stones now deteriorate, then this 
may be the best record ever recorded.</i></p>
