<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>REES
CEMETERY (Pole Cat Hollow, near Moore County Line), LINCOLN COUNTY TENNESSEE<font COLOR="#000080"><br>
  <img border="0" src="ReesCemTopo.jpg" width="711" height="606"><br>
  From the above map we are given the Rees Cemetery GPS location. We can see it 
is next to the Moore / Lincoln County Line.<br>

  <font color="#000080"><b>Location: From Fayetteville go around the 
bypass to Hwy 64 and turn east (or right). Go about a mile and turn left on Hwy 
50 called Lynchburg Highway. Follow that about 4+ miles to Booneville Road and 
turn left (north) toward Booneville. Go past Booneville and junction onto 
Charity Road aka Hwy 129 continuing on less than a mile and cross the west 
branch of Mulberry Creek and immediately turn left onto Polecat Hollow Road. 
Follow Polecat Hollow Road less than two miles and pass the last house on the 
right and go to the big barn and park where the road basically ends. With 
permission go to the gate on (your) right side of the barn and go thru that 
closing it and walk straight up (west &amp; to the north) the slope for 300 yards 
and the cemetery is in that round thicket in front of you. There is a shallow rock wall 
around it and inside that is an old fence. Carry a brush whacker with you as the 
blackberry briars are very prickly and need to be mashed or cut down to get to 
the stones. <br>
While there I subjected it to a two hour sling blade and brush cutting and made 
the Cardinals &amp; Red Tail Hawks mad at me. The hawks circled and fussed overhead 
and the Cardinals sat on a nearby limb chirping as I worked. That clearing I did was 
not enough to make much difference in the long run. <br>
This property is for sale and is in the process of changing hands. Who knows the 
attitude of the new owner toward cemetery visitors. Mr. Russel from down the 
hollow 1/4 mile now watches the property and can clear you for permission for 
now.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows more clearly the cemetery under a few trees upon the 
side of the slope. The formal road ends at the barn, but really at the last 
house on the right just before the barn. The old house is a historic structure 
probably founded by the folk who lye in this cemetery. <br>
There are a few small 
trees showing on this map, in front of the cemetery and between the barn, which 
have since been cleared leaving the cemetery in full view from the bottom of the 
hill at the barn. It will show up as a distant clump of trees unless someone 
completely clears the cemetery. The biggest trees 
are on the upside of the slope beside the cemetery.</font></b><br>
