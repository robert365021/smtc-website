Bedford County Court Minutes
Wilhoite, Wiley Died before 12 July 1838 as shown in the suit of James M. Jones and wife vs John Bruton and others. The wife of James M. Jones was Polly Jones, formerly Polly Wilhoit, the sister of Willey Wilhoit 
who died intestate without issue, but he left brothers &amp; sisters. The suit is against Jacob Wilhoit, Jane Wilhoit, all of Bedford County, and John Bruton whose residence is unknown. James M. Jones has purchased the 
interest of John Bruton and wife Emily. Jones has purchased 4 shares and also owns the share in right of his wife, Polly, and the other 2 shares are held by Jacob and Jane.</PRE>
<PRE>(Bed TN Ch Ct Min 1/370) 28 December 1843 in the suit of Harris Austin &amp; wife Emily vs John Brewton &amp; Pearce Wilhoit, it is stated that Wiley Wilhoit died some 8 or 10 years ago, that he was the brother of Emily Austin, 
that Pearce Wilhoit was administrator. About the time of the death of Wiley Wilhoit, Emily was the wife of John Brewton and he deserted her &amp; fled to parts unknown and that she married Harris Austin in 1841. She has 
since heard that John Brewton is still living and she never obtained a divorce from Brewton. The money coming to Emily from the estate of her brother is to be paid to her and neither her former husband nor her new 
husband is to have any part (IBID 2/275)

Jacob Wilhoite, Jr. born 1781, died 1833. Bedford County, Tennessee; married 2 Dec. 1803. Mary &quot;Polly&quot;, POWELL. she was born 1786, North Carolina and died Nov 1863, Bedford County, Tennessee. Tennessee. Jacob Wilhoite
 lived on Goose Creek Road aka Big Flat Creek. In the back of the house were cemetery stones. The ones in front of the barn are carved grave covers one at least 10' X 10' by about 8&quot; inches thick and are thought to be Jacob Wilhoite Jr.'s 
b. 1781 family gravestones. USGS mapping has that location pegged as the Parker cemetery. A newspaper article stated that when Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Wilhoite died, she was buried in the family cemetery. We believe that Jacob (II, b. 1781) 
and son Wiley who died of Cholera in 1833 and were thus buried there on their property in the family graveyard. This farm may have fallen into the hands of a daughter Milly Wilhoite who was married to Harris Austin. When Milly
 died first Harris sold property to an Isaiah Parker who if lived there may have caused this cemetery to carry his name. If this Isaiah Parker was the one born in 1830, he is buried in the nearby Rosebank cemetery and not here.</PRE>
<PRE>Mary &quot;Polly&quot;, POWELL WILHOITE was born 1786, North Carolina and died Nov 1863, Bedford County, Tennessee. She married 2 Dec. 1803 to Jacob Wilhoite, Jr. (II) born 1781, died 1833, Bedford County, Tennessee. She is 
thought to be interred in the graveyard beside her husband. Fieldstones &amp; carved grave covers without inscription were found there verifying burials are there. One of them in front of the barn 40 feet is thought to be the gravestone for
Jacob WILHOITE JR.</PRE>
<PRE>A newspaper article stated that when Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Wilhoite died, she was buried in the family cemetery. It is thought that Jacob (II) b. 1781 and son Wiley died of Cholera in 1833 and were thus buried on the property. Later Mary joined them.</PRE>
<PRE>Willie/Wiley Wilhoite - Birth:  1812 - Death:  1833, Flat Creek (Bedford County), Bedford County, Tennessee, Believed to have died in a Cholea Epidemic of 1833. He along with his father were buried in the cemetery on their home place.
Source of information is: Ancestors and Descendents of Jacob Wilhoite 1751-1821 by Jacob (d. 2007) &amp; Faye Wilhoite.

The weakness of this presentation may be that Harris &amp; Milly Austin are possibly buried either in the nearby Flat Creek cemetery about one mile east of here or the Center Church Cemetery about two miles northwest of here. Both of these
cemeteries have large unmarked grave populations with Flat Creek having the most. 
There are also several small graveyards with no marked stones in them within a mile of this place. No one will probably ever figure out who is buried in these places which now become small clumps of trees with unmarked rocks in them unless we can
reconstruct the land deeds, Census locations and age of the cemeteries better and then it is still an estimate.  

So much for how the early pioneers were interred as they spread across and populated this land, especially in a time before and after the Civil War (1861-1865) when resources for carved gravestone were scarce in the south. I realize to the
casual observer this is too much information with all the details of this place shown above. However, the keenly interested will take away a feel and vision of this location where these old ancestors lived and ultimately are buried 
as they have thousands of descendents today.
