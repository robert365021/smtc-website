  From the above map we are given the Parker aka Wilhoite Cemetery GPS location. 
		There are no known Parkers buried here. I think the Parker (thought to 
		be Isaiah) owner is interred in the Rosebank Cemetery.<br>

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Go southeast out of Shelbyville 
		several miles to Flat Creek and turn right on Old Center Church Road. 
		Follow that for about a 1/4 mile and turn left on Goose Creek Road. 
		Follow that for about 1 and 1/2 miles and there on your left above the 
		road will be an old barn. Just a bit further is the gate on the left 
		which is the access to this site. The cemetery is about 40 feet in front of the 
		barn. There is a fence about 15 feet from the barn and across that fence 
		is the gravestones or slabs. <br>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery and other farm assets more clearly under a few trees in front of 
		the barn or between the barn and road in a clump of trees. There is a 
  		gate shown with a very crooked farm road up to the site shown on this 
		map. All this is on the south 
  side of the Goose Creek Road. I would think this barn is as old as the 
		cemetery.<br>

		This GPS reading was made at the gate into the place. It is marked by a 
		green circle pointer.</font></b><br>
