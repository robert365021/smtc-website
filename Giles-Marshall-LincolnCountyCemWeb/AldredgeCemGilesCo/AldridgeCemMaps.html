Location: Go Hwy 11 (Minor Hill Rd) to Minor Hill and turn southeast (left) on 
Salem Road and go nearly to the Alabama State line and turn left (east) on the Earl 
Townsend Road and go until you reach the last driveway on the left before the road bears back north 90 degrees northward 
(left). The old Smith Howard house is still standing today. The cemetery will be on your 
left just into the tree line on the right of the driveway to the new house owned 
by the daughter (&amp; her husband) of David &amp; Annie Hendrix. You must have permission. This is a 
private cemetery. That means no deed exist for the 
separation of the cemetery from the surrounding owner's land. See Smitty Townsend 
of this neighborhood for help in viewing 
this cemetery. The Hendrix, Townsend, Howard, Legg &amp; Coffman &amp; Aldredge/(Eldridge) have lived in 
this little valley/hollow or &quot;hollar&quot;&nbsp; for more than a hundred fifty years. 
Please respect the right of the living and the deceased to their right to a quiet privacy. You will then be welcomed. Smitty did show up with his sawed off shotgun. 
HA! No, he did not-just kidding, he was one of the most pleasant &amp; helpful&nbsp; 
persons I've met in a while and he knew much of folk lore &amp; recent history of this 
cemetery.)</font></b></span><font size="2" color="#000080"><b><br>

This Aerial view shows the cemetery location marked with a red check just inside 
the tree line on a small ledge. Turn into the driveway and go past the old Smith 
Howard home and park before the driveway bends left and walk straight into the 
woods. Go about 50 feet into the woods and turn east (right) and walk about 50 
yards and you will see the Texas Bear Grass (or Cactus) planted inside the 
cemetery. In the spring time you will find the Buttercups (or Daffodils) in full 
bloom completely covering the cemetery area.<br>

This photo marking the location of the cemetery in white arrows was made 
standing in the driveway just before it bends left. We are shooting 
northward. None of the Green Cedars mark the cemetery. The only Cedar in this 
cemetery was a dead cedar log that had fallen years ago and was still there 
under the recent fallen Locust Tree. <br>
Smitty and I were standing here while 
putting the final information touches on this cemetery when we heard the 
cackling call of flocks of south bound herons over head. When we gazed upward we saw wave 
after wave of them winging their way southward toward the summer nesting grounds 
in the swamps of Louisiana/Florida &amp; Alabama. They largely kept a V formation as 
do the Geese. It was an impressive site for a city dweller to experience. We 
cannot see such as that in the city because of all the noise. I also know flocks 
of birds avoid flying over cities.<br>
