</b> Genealogy by 
Linda Dean<b><br>
&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>There was thought to be an Aldredge/(Eldredge) 
family living near here and the woman of the house was of American Indian 
descent. The family wouldn't let her be buried with the white people across the 
street in the Legg-Coffman Cemetery so this cemetery was created for her. <br>
<br>
The Aldredge Cemetery is straight back upon the hill side 350 yards from where 
Smith Howard was raised and in my estimation the Aldredge family may have lived 
in that old house before the Howards did. Those old houses typically were 
founded from about 1840 to 1890. I am told this is Smith Howard's parent's house 
and it is still standing today, no one is living in it as it has been long since 
abandoned.

The listing above is the only marked grave in this cemetery that I could find. If you can 
identify the unmarked graves please write me and list them for inclusion here. <br>
<br>
This cemetery was about 50 feet by 40 feet and the whole site was covered in 
fully bloomed (spring time) Buttercups with also about 5 rugged Texas Bear Grass plants 
that can live hundreds of years. All these plants were lovingly planted by 
someone in the past with great respect for the interred here. <br>
<br>
I could not survey the unmarked graves because of the flowers, but did notice 
two fieldstones still standing. Also the five Texas Bear Grass Plants may mark 
graves as they were scattered as if they did.<br>
<br>
We are indebted to Smitty Townsend for taking me to this site; to Sue Davis and 
her friend Linda Dean for their knowledge of this place and also the book Giles 
County Cemeteries by the Historical Society, 1985. </p>
