			<b>With this photo I am showing you the clump of trees where the 
			Parker grave(s) is located according to mapping. I cannot confirm 
			this because I did not stop and visit this site. The actual GPS 
			takes one northwest up close to the top of that hill on the left 
			maybe in the middle of those cattle and I am inclined to believe 
			there is no monument up there. Therefore I will look first in that 
			clump of trees. If I am correct the GPS needs correcting.</b><br>
