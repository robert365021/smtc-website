			<p><b>No graves can be identified

			where these grave inhabitant likely lived is known to have belonged 
			to the Parker family sometime in the 19th century. Further research 
			needed in Census and land records of Bedford County. <br>

			<p><b>Large stack-stone limestone Slabs mark the 
			graves of unknown persons buried here. This cemetery is not 
			documented by anyone in the past. <br>
			Typically these types tombs were in style from about 1820 to 1875.<br>
			The only reason I gave this cemetery the name Parker cemetery is 
			because the lady who lives in the house across the road said the 
			folks that lived in their house a long time ago were the Parker 
			family. </b></p>

			Gammill Road..</i></p>
