        <i>Transcribed as follows: Richardson &amp; Thomas Bell is well. F.M. Baker 
        is also well. We left Jas Bevers, Thos Maxey, Fate Ball and Jas/(or gus) 
        Randolph at Mown City (Mound City) on the Ohio River. They was all sick 
        and I have not heard from them since. Give my respects to all inquiring 
        friends, So nothing more at present. Yours Respectfully Marquis L. (

        Since we find no grave record for the above mentioned Thomas H Maxey we 
        may have a grave location issue. There are two versions of where he 
        died. One version which comes from the relatives says Thomas H. was 
        captured at Ft. Donelson and transferred to Camp Morton in Indianapolis, 
        Indiana where he died and was obviously buried in a mass grave there. 
        However he is not listed in the Confederate burials At Crown Hill 
        Cemetery, Lot 32, Indianapolis, Ind. that we have found. Therefore, 
        since the official War Dept records is likely to be more accurate noting 
        Mound City Ill., he was listed in Mound City National Cemetery in 
        Findagrave by Cecil Wayne Austin, 30 Nov 2010.<br>
