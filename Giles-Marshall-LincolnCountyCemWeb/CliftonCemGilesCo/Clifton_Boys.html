        Transcribed as follows: <i>&quot;Three sons and a son-in-law of Marmaduke and 
        Sarah Clifton answered the call December 1861 for CSA enlistments.<br>
        John Martin Clifton was in Co. D, 19th (Biffle's) Tennessee Cavalry.<br>
        Doctor Wisdom Clifton, Marquis Lafayette Clifton and Thomas H. Maxey 
        (husband of Emily Clifton) were all in Co G, 53rd Tennessee Infantry. 
        They were captured at Fort Donaldson 16 February 1862 and imprisoned at 
        Camp Morton, Indiana where Maxey died 2 March 1862.<br>
        D. W. and M. L. were later released and reorganized September 1862. M. 
        L. was at Port Hudson, LA in February 1863. He was hospitalized with a 
        leg wound.&quot;<br>

        Since no one as of 29 Nov 2010 has found a grave record for Thomas H Maxey we 
        have a grave location issue. There are two versions of where he 
        died. One version which comes from the relatives says Thomas H. was 
        captured at Ft. Donelson and transferred to Camp Morton in Indianapolis, 
        Indiana where he died and was obviously buried in a mass grave there. 
        However he is not listed (or we have not found him) in the Confederate burials At Crown Hill 
        Cemetery, Lot 32, Indianapolis, Indiana. The official War Dept records 
        are likely to be more accurate noting 
        Mound City Illinois. He therefore was thus listed in Mound City National Cemetery in 
        Findagrave by Cecil Wayne Austin, 30 Nov 2010.<br>
