		EPPS, John Norris, Mar 27, 1841 - Aug 25, 1929. Father (gravestone)<br>
		<br>
		He was the son of James C. &amp; Nancy Ann Norris Epps; 1st married Hepsey 
		Prosser born in 1847, married James N. (Norris) Epps on 20 Dec 1860. 
		Hepsey died in 1866 at a very young age and at the time of death she had 
		three or four children. I do not know how many. It is believed that 
		Hepsey is buried in the Prosser Cemetery that has been destroyed at the 
		foot of Bartlett Hollow. [Bobby Prosser, 28 Mar 2015] On Nov 9, 1871 J.N. 
		Epps married Sarah E. &quot;Sallie&quot; Cole in Lincoln County Tennessee. Sallie 
		died May 14, 1876. We are uncertain of Sallie's burial location in 
		Lincoln Co..<br>
		J.N. Epps was next married to Florence Cole November 2, 1876 in Lincoln 
		County Tennessee (by William Buntley, JP). Florence outlived him and 
		lies beside her husband in this cemetery.</font></b></p>

		John Norris Epps is interred in the Unity Cem with his 3rd wife and 
		other members of his family. He was a Confederate Soldier. He 
		participated in the early 1900s in a questionnaire session that yielded 
		a book. These questions were about their civil war participation and 
		their heritage. In this book he mentions his ancestors for about two 
		generations back. Parents being well known as James C. &amp; Nancy Norris 
		Epps.<br>
		<br>
		His mother Nancy lies in this cemetery. His father James C. Epps is 
		listed, but no one lately has identified his marker. We believe it was 
		destroyed or never existed.<br>
