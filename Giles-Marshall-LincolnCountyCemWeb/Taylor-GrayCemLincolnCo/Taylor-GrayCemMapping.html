Fayetteville go east on Hwy 64 to Kelso and turn (right) south on Teal Hollow Rd 
or Old Highway 64. Go to the Main Kelso intersection and turn left (southeast) 
following Teal Hollow Rd. Follow that a fw hundred yards until you see a slope on your left and up a slope 
will be a new home. Just past that and down in front 
(to your 
right of the home) is the cemetery under a grove of trees. The gentleman who owns 
the home is the owner of the land surrounding the cemetery, so permission is 
needed. He was 
the one that pointed this cemetery out to me when I was at Kelso 
Cemetery. It is well mapped. Careful here the flesh ripping Saw Briars are rough in this 
cemetery. Wear thick clothing</b></font></p>
