CEMETERY, Old Elkton Pike, 
LINCOLN COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Lay Cemetery along the north side 
of Hickory Ridge Road as N 35.15262 X W 
-86.68706. This cemetery is mapped incorrectly too far west about 200 yards. <br>

Location: From Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64 to the junction on Hwy 64 &amp; Hwy 
273,&nbsp; Turn left (south) &amp; pass by Old Rail Road Bed Road on the left and go 
about 2 tenths of a mile further and turn left on Hickory Ridge Road. Follow 
that until it bends back left (southwest) and park and climb up the slight ridge 
on the right about 50 yards from the road. The cemetery a is bit hard to see, 
but is 
located along that slight ridge which spans north east to south west running 
parallel with the road after the road bends left. If you pass the driveway to a home on the 
right you have gone too far. I do not know who owns the property but I am told 
it is an individual living in a home fronting Old Elkton Pike to the north of the 
cemetery.</b></p>
