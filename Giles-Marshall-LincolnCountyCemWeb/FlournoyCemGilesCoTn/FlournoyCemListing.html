			<p class="MsoNormal">Unknown tombstone but likely one of the missing 
			ones above. It is an adult tomb with an fallen extension and the top 
			turned upside down:

			Scrap of a box tomb has &quot;FLOUR(NOY)&quot; and &quot;00&quot;. 
			This is probably the remains of the William C. Flournoy monument because we 
			can make out Flournoy and perhaps the scrap of a year birth date 
			18(00)** <a href="IMG_8437.JPG">8437</a></p></div>

			<p class="MsoNormal">Though the cemetery is in bad shape most of 
			this was caused by a visiting vandal (an idiot thinking he was going to find 
			treasure) in years past, but sometime after the black &amp; 
			white photo on Findagrave (1950s?) and also damage by invasive and 
			falling trees rooting up the tombs and sending large trunks and 
			limbs smashing down in storms. Most of these stones could be set 
			back up with the right equipment, interest and time. Obviously there 
			are two more inscriptions available to be read by turning the stones 
			with the inscriptions face up. I think one of those is for William 
			C. Flournoy (large stand up) &amp; perhaps the other one was for William 
			Alexander Trotter. Box tomb on the right?</p>
