NE out Hwy 31 Alt/Hwy 11 toward I-65 and turn right Beechwood Farm Road and 
bend back toward the south. Permission can be granted at the end of that road by Mr 
or Mrs Clayton Beahl. I left their home going north and according to instructions I turned right 
into the Red Gate going east and went across an in-ground cattle gap about 300 
yards out and then came to another fence gate. This was about 350 yards south of 
the cemetery. I was instructed to park, go thru that gate and walk to the 
cemetery making certain I closed all gates behind me. One can see the cemetery in 
a round clump of trees north along the fence line, but out in the field. </font>
<font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Alternate Historical instructions: Hwy 31A; 
Locust Hill, where the Flournoys' settled in 1816; turn right on top of Barlar 
Hill (meaning back from Barlar's store on left about 400 yards). Located on farm now owned by 
Clayton and Mary Haehl; go through gate, past a big barn to an old house, turn 
left and the cemetery is in a grove of trees. Box tombs, very broken up. 1985.<br>

This aerial map highlights the cemetery in the grove of trees out in a field. 
That road is not on the same land pwner and has a fence between the cemetery and 
the road.<br>

This photo made about 1950 shows the tombs largely standing. Since this photo 
and today the vandals have paid a visit here and broken up all the tombs looking 
for treasure which I am sure the idiots never find. Mr. Beahl has been here 29 
years and said the stones have been broken only sparsely since he was here by 
falling trees. So we know the mass carnage was caused by vandals opening the tombs looking 
for treasure. As we can barely see in this photo there is a stand up tomb located just right 
center of the photo that was upright then. It has a massive base, top, but had 
four sides and a top that now lye on the ground face down leaving us no way to 
read it anymore. The box tomb on the right edge of the photo shown as still 
standing is fallen and the top with the inscription turned upside down.&nbsp; 
That I am sure was caused when the vandals pulled the tomb top (with the 
inscription) off letting it flip over face down. I think these are for Sarah 
Cannon or William Alexander Trotter, but as much as 5 tons of stone keep us from 
being sure.&nbsp; I modified a photo shown here from findagrave to depict the 
damage by vandals to this cemetery. Two things dating this photo are the Black 
Angus cattle and the black &amp; white photo. Angus cattle did not become a wide 
spread breed until about 1950s. I remember when they were introduced only 
because my Father who was always interested in Farming mentioned it. He was 
never a serious farmer but kept up with the latest in developments. So from that 
we can date this photo as after about 1952 but certainly before the Beahls' 
moved here in about 1987. Being black &amp; white can date it as before 1960 when 
widespread development of color film came into use. Cattle will rub on the tall 
stones eventually causing them to fall but box tombs are too low to the ground 
for that.</font></b></p>
