</b><b>This is a area view of the
memorials involved. I believe the stone on the right is the base for the Dr.
Upshaw marker on the left. The middle stone is a top of a Box tomb with stones
that form it into a box, assembled under it when present. The white car in the
photo is traveling at least 70 miles per hour north on I-65. Photo made looking
northwest at I-65. <i><br>

resist displaying this tribute to our soldiers.<br>

This 2006 historical marker also on this rest stop. I remember all the fun trips
we made to Nashville as a teenager before the Interstate and it was much more
time consuming to go there from Northern Alabama. WA 19 Apr 2008.<br>
