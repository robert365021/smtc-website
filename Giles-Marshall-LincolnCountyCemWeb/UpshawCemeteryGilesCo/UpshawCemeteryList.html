</b><b>Location: Cemetery on Interstate 65
North Rest Stop Mile Marker 2. It is the first rest stop going north after passing
the Alabama/Tennessee Line out to the left in the rest stop next to the interstate.
I was told these graves were lost under the Interstate somewhere. According to
Giles County Historical Cemetery book these stones were found piled up in a barn
and were previously used as stepping stones.</b></p>
