</b><b>Location: Go 
northeast on Highway 31A out of Pulaski. Turn left on Woodlawn Rd. after several 
miles and go just over a mile Woodlawn dead ends in the Berea community. Then turn right 
onto Odd Fellows Hall Rd. Go about 1.5 miles and the cemetery is behind but 
northeast (to your right) of the old Antebellum home where the Portress family 
lived now owned by Pam &amp; her husband. Pam is one of the administrators of the 
Maplewood Cemetery. Access is not thru their property, but at the next cattle gate past 
the home.&nbsp; The home and cemetery are now on separate plots of land. So far 
as I know this is strictly a family cemetery and no deed ever existed as a 
separate plot for burial. Somewhat of a right of way exist, but is now mainly 
used by the cattle farmer. <br>
