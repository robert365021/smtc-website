&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>**&nbsp;</b>Willis 
remarried to Levena Simmons m. 16 Jan 1866 after the death of Rebecca. 
He  
1st married to Mary Rebecca &quot;Polly&quot; Brown in Virginia in 1827 who later assumed her middle name 
of Rebecca. (my 
Conclusion) Her mother Sallie Brown is found in the 1870 census as 70 years old 
adding proof to the above conclusion.</p>
<p>*** 
David was 1st 
married to Fauntainella Portress listed above. After Fauntainella died in 1877 
David remarried to Sue [Strong] [McClellan] of Limestone County Alabama. Sue was a widow 
of William C. McClellan resulting from the Civil 
War. See McClellan Cemetery Limestone Co Alabama. David &amp; Sue West are both 
interred in Maplewood Cemetery in Pulaski in unmarked graves I believe in plot 
608 New Maplewood section.

So we can visualize from this grave and census info that the Willis &amp; Rebecca Portress 
family left Virgina and arrived in Tennessee about 1830 and built or purchased 
the ole 2 story mansion home place to the southeast of the cemetery. The first children were 
born before they left Virginia and after living in Tennessee and rearing 
children one of the daughters Ann Rebecca Portress married Benjamin F. Moore and then this 
extended family lived a 
fairly long life (to early 1900s) after the death of Willis &amp; Rebecca Portress. Another son Jackson McFerrin Portress lived longer so he may 
or may not have 
taken over the farm after the death of the Benjamin Moore family, but there is 
no evidence of that in the above display of information. These conclusions just follow the grave and census 
patterns.</b></p>
<p><b>
While this cemetery has been neglected and abused in the past from falling 
trees, livestock. It would do no good to restore &amp; stand the stones back up without 
protection from the cattle and elimination of the trees. Nor are the bases of 
the stones level enough to stand on the side of a hill. This lack levelness adds another reason the stones have 
all fallen down. So restoring this cemetery including fencing and 
restoration of the stones is not plausible unless it is done correctly and then a 
minimal amount of maintenance is applied to keep the vegetation out and the 
stones level. Also some of the stones need to be glued back. I recommend a three 
wire fence with the upper and lower wires smooth and the center one barbed wire. 
That would allow the cattle to eat the grass inside the fence to about 2 feet in 
without allowing them to push over the fence trying to get to the grass out of 
reach. The other part of the restored cemetery stones area could then be trimmed 
with a weed eater about 3 times each summer and that is a plan for long term 
survival of this cemetery. Care should be taken not to allow any growth of 
trees. I call this a minimal maintenance cemetery method. <br>
