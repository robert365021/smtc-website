This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Carpenter Cemetery along the west side 
of Old Railroad Bed Road as N 35.05481 X W 
-86.73352. This cemetery is mapped incorrectly too far west and south of this 
place about 500 yards. Mr. Brown informed me of this cemetery location. He lives 
south of the cemetery about 200 yards.<br>

Location: From 
Taft Tennessee (junction of Old Rail Road Bed Road and Hwy 110) go north on Old Rail Road Bed Road about two+ miles. 
After 
you pass Carpenter Hollow Road on the left look for a residential road into the 
Brown place about another 1/2 mile on the left. Pass that residential road on the left. 
Almost immediately after passing that you will 
notice a culvert over the large ditch on the left (west) side of the road. That is your 
access. Go thru the gate after securing a key and bear just slightly southward 
from due west. Go across the field 
and climb the tree covered steep slope. The cemetery resides under 
large hardwood (not evergreen) trees on the side of that hill about 60 
yards up the slope. Its a steep slope so have shoes that grip the slick moss 
covered surface and hold onto the trees as you climb up. If you tumble back you 
will be injured. I think some in 
the Brown family as of Oct&nbsp;2016 living just south of here perhaps owns this land.</b></p>
