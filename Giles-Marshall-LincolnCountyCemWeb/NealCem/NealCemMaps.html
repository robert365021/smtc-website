Rd, Pulaski, GILES COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br>

This map shows the Neal Cemetery inside a yellow highlighted area. I have seen
no name for this cemetery but given that there was only one stone found I am
calling it the Neal Cemetery. These GPS coordinates are probably wrong. I
believe this cemetery found by traveling out of town to be just before one drives by Mark
St. Here they are anyway. N35 degrees 11.77261' X W87 degrees 0.01839' If
the truth be known the closer coordinates are: N35 degrees 11.816' X W87 degrees
0.0260'<br>

This Topographical Map shows what I am calling the Neal Cemetery, but shown as the
Patterson Cemetery or near that cemetery. There is a real old Patterson Cemetery that has been moved
to Maple Hill Cemetery. The book Giles County Tennessee Cemeteries mentions
that, but says it is located out Hwy 64. That listing has no one there by the
name of Neal which is another indicator of a different cemetery.<br>

This aerial view shows the rock wall enclosure next to the road and just before
Mark St.<br>
