This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Brown-Baugh Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="Brown-BaughRd.jpg" width="1600" height="807"><br>
Directions: Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski to Tarpley and bear right onto 
Prospect aka Aspen Hill Road. Go less than a mile and turn right into Roy Road and follow that 
to a locked gate with &quot;No Trespassing&quot; Signs posted on it. With permission &amp; a 
key go thru that to the house straight ahead. To the right of the house 50 yards 
you will see the cemetery partly fenced under the trees. It is labeled the Baugh 
Cemetery on GNIS Maps.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery just north of the residential house. The 
Baugh section of the cemetery is fenced with the (older) Brown Box tombs in front of 
the fence to the east. While there I noticed the Lewis Brown box tomb appeared to 
have been 
recently vandalized. It was lying open &amp; broken on the ground. The north side had caved off and 
the corner of the top broken off. The inscription is still in place. We can see 
the 
tomb is not harmed when this aerial photo was made a couple of years ago. It is 
showing up here as a tiny rectangular shaped object. This time phases the crime 
somewhat.<br>
