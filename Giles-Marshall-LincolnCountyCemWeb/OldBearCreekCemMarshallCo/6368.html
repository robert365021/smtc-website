Our focus is on the stone in the left of the photo for Revolutionary War
Soldier, Jacob Lowrance.<br>
<img border="0" src="6368.JPG" width="753" height="572"><br>
Jacob Lowrance memorial. We see here the extent of the crumbling away. This one
foot peice is all that is left of a 5 feet tall stone including the part that
goes underground.<br>

</i>LOWRANCE, Jacob, 7 Aug 1759 - 31 May 1855. &quot;Revolutionary
Soldier.&quot; (Tombstone crumbling badly.)<i> <font color="#000080">Inscription:
SACRED -- To the memory of -- Jacob Lowrance -- born Aug 7th 1759 -- died July
24th 1855.&nbsp;<br>
Historians have said this: An old Pear Tree marks
the burial stone of Jacob Lowrance (1759-1855), a Revolutionary War veteran who
came to the Bear Creek community from Georgia or South Carolina in the early
1800s. [Frankly, I think the Pear Tree has long since decayed. WA. 8 Aug 2008]<br>
I believe this style stone in this area of the country is
rampant with structural failure. I know of others who have this type
memorial who died about the same time and their
stones are crumbling just as badly or worse.&nbsp;</i></font></b><b><br>
