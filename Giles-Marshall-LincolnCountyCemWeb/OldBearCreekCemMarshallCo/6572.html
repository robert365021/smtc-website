BEAR CREEK
CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY 1807-1836, MARSHALL COUNTY Aft. 1836.<br>
</b><img border="0" src="6577.JPG" width="623" height="831"><b><i><br>
</i><font color="#000080">The memorial for Capt. James Wade Nowlin, a casualty of the Civil
War. I chose not to clear the thorny briars around this memorial. To clear that
away will leave the stone vulnerable to the livestock that freely roam here.
They will rub against the memorial and cause it to eventually fall. There is a
chain link fence around this cemetery but that has long since been trampled down
by the livestock. Unbelievable isn't it!</font><br>

NOWLIN, Captain James Wade, 15 Jan 1830 -
15 Feb 1862, 7th Tex Regiment, C.S.A., Fell while leading charge in
the Battle of Ft Donelson, (Tenn.)<br>
Inscription: &quot;CAPT. JAMES WADE -- NOWLIN -- 7th TEX., Regiment, -- BORN
JAN. 1830. -- HE FELL WHILE LEADING A CHARGE&nbsp; -- IN BATTLE AT FT. DONELSON,
-- Feb 15, 1862.&nbsp;<br>
HIS LIFE BLOOD ATTESTED HIS CONVICTION AND
ADHERENCE TO PRINCIPLE THOUGH CUT DOWN BY HIS FOE, YET OVER DEATH HE WAS
VICTORIOUS &amp; NOW WEARS LAURELS IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD.&quot;<br>
NOWLIN, Bentley Jabus, 31 Jan 1855 - 27
Feb 1864. &quot;Son of James Wade Nowlin.'<br>
NOWLIN, William Russell, 27 Oct 1858 - 15 Sep 1862. &quot;Son of James Wade
Nowlin.&quot; (Large monument also has name of ORR, Wm. Leonodas, no dates.)<i><br>
</i>
ORR, Wm. Leonodas, no dates. (Same stone with Nowlin family.)<br>
The thorns kept me from seeing the back side of this memorial where I presume
the two Nowlin children and William Leonodas Orr inscriptions are located.<br>
