This is a one of several slabs that appear to be tops of box tombs with no inscription.
I must say it is possible they are all face down with inscription on the other
side but they are all still in alignment as if not to have been disturbed so I
conclude there is no markings on them. This is consistent with how old grave
yards spring up. They grow from the center out in both east &amp; westerly
directions with the center of the cemetery often times without much in the way
of inscribed marked stones. That is because marked stones did not come into use
until about 1815 to 1820 and many of these old graveyards were used prior to
then. Of course as everyone knows some of these marked graves belong to slaves
of early times.</b></center>

We are looking at the last three photos of boxtomb tops without any markings
between us and the umbrella. This is also a horse path thru the cemetery which
accounts for the low grass.<br>

This group of stones form the base of an old box tomb. What is missing
is the inscribed top. It may be nearby underground or to be never found because
vandals took it and or broke and scattered it.</b></p>
