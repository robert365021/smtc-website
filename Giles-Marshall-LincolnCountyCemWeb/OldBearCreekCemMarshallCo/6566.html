livestock. The below photo is next to this but not in the picture. I believe the
Oscar Brown inscription to be on the side next to the ground under this
memorial.<br>

BROWN, Oscar L., 10 Jul 1863 - 22 Oct
1864.<br>
Only the footstone with initials O. L. B. are photographed here and was found by
this researcher in Feb 2008, but the inscription is probably on the underside of
the fallen memorials here in the Brown family plots. Sadly all of the Brown
memorials are tumbled and also are very heavy to turn over.<i><br>
