This is a fieldstone but it is not clear that it marks a grave. We are near
the center of the cemetery and there are many such stone in the center. Many of
them clearly mark graves and others do not have the traits that show they mark
graves.</b></center>

<b>This is a one of several slabs that appear to
be tops of boxtombs with no inscription. I must say it is possible they are all
face down with inscription on the other side but they are all still in alignment
as if not to have been disturbed so I conclude there is no markings on them.
This is consistent with how old grave yards spring up. They grow from the center
out in both east &amp; westerly directions with the center of the cemetery often
times without much in the way of inscribed marked stones in the center. That is because marked
stones did not come into use until about 1815 to 1820 and many of these old
graveyards were used prior to then.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
