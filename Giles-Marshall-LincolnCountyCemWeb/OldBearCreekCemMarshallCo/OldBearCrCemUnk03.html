That dark mossy stone in the center of the photo clearly marks a grave. It is
facing east/west in a north/south row. It is standing on its edge partly buried
underground. It may be a crumbled carved stone but does not have enough form
left to determine that. We are still in the upper part of the cemetery where
we began photography. That is the western fence row one can see in the
background.</b></center>

<b>In this clump of tree stumps and brush are the
remnants of an iron fence around a grave or graves. I did not see any
gravestones here but if one scratched around there might be a memorial found just
under the topsoil. Trees have sprang up here destroying the place.<br>
<img border="0" src="u6379.JPG" width="686" height="511"><br>
Here are&nbsp; at least three graves marked by stones. Two of them have
footstones but may just be headstone for another row. I can see five stones but
cannot tell for sure. Three of them are set in a way that suggest they are marking graves
and the other two may be out of place or be footstones.</b></p>
