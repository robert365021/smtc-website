This road map shows the cemetery on the northwest side of Minor Hill on Barber 
Shop Road. Go south on Hwy 11 to Minor Hill and up to the top of the hill and&nbsp; 
turn right on Puncheon Branch Rd and then back right (north) on Jackson Hollow 
Rd. After less than a mile turn back left on Barber Shop Rd aka Fox Hollow Rd and nearly 
immediately turn left to cross the concrete bridge over the creek. Drive the 
50 yards up to the cemetery slipping and sliding in the wrong weather. HA!. 
There was a steep drop down to the concrete bridge and that will probably get 
deeper with time so watch out on that. Please go here with good intentions and 
honor in your heart. Otherwise there are nearby neighbors watching over this 
cemetery.<br>
