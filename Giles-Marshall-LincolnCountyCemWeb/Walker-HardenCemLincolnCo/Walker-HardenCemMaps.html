junction of Highway 50/55 &amp; Hwy 64 go north about 2 miles and look to your 
left for C.A. Boaz road. Turn left there and double back almost opposite the 
direction you were going on Hwy 50. That directin is about due west. Follow that 
to the next to the last house and with permission turn right (north) into that residence lane 
and the cemetery will be found on their property. They are gracious host and 
will likely accompany you to the cemetery if their time permits. Horses are 
found in this premises so you are at your own risk, but I found them very 
friendly.</b></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><br>

falling on them and maybe livestock.<br>
