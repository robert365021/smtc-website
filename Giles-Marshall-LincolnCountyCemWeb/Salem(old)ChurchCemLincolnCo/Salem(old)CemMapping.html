Location: From 
Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64w to Boonshill and turn north and at the dead end turn left on 
Red Oak Road. Go past the Boonshill Church &amp; Cemetery on your left when you are just back from the Boonshill black CP Church building 
abandoned several years ago. The cemetery is southeast of there just 
south of a small pond about 400 yards from the Red Oak Road . This was located 
on Phillip Thomason's farm in (1990), just to the south of a small pond on the 
hill, but to the south-west of <br>
his house.</b></font><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080" size="2">
