There are unknown graves here known only by our creator.<br>

The Old Salem cemetery 
is located on Philip Thomason's farm, just to the south of the pond on the hill, 
but to the south-west of
his house. (1990). This is on Red Oak Road<br>
about 3/4 mile west of the Boonshill 
Church &amp; Cemetery. Of course as stated the original Salem Church 
Congregation was 
nearby. It is apparent that there will be Wilson graves<br>
here. the Boone 
Wilson Cemetery is located 700 yards to the west of this place, but Andrew&nbsp; 
or Ann Wilson does not show up in that listing.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>It is 
located on Red Oak Road and that concrete building nearby that is a church 
building was the black congregation, also a Cumberland Presbyterian Church. I 
(John) 
remember when the black congregation still met there. They 
disbanded around&nbsp;25 to 30 years ago. <br>
The old Salem building abandoned in 1892 is no longer there.&nbsp;It stood a good 
ways off the road.&nbsp;I (John) was told that it was a log structure.&nbsp; If you can see a 
small pond south of Red Oak Road across the field at a fence row, back southeast 
of the black congregation block building that is about where it was. Across the 
fence is wooded area now.&nbsp;When last there 5 or 6 years ago I could not even find the markers. I was trying to show some of the Wilson family where it is.&nbsp; 
This was in the summer when everything was grown up in weeds and 
grass.&nbsp;I didn't want to
stomp around too much for fear of snakes. I think it was around 1990 when I was 
there and recorded the marker information above.</b></p>
