<p align="left"><b>There are fifteen graves remaining on this site. Of the fifteen, only two have 
any inscription remaining on the markers. several of the graves/and or 
gravestones in the past were moved to Boonshill. They are:<br/>
<br/>
WILSON, Mary E., daughter of Andrew and Ann Wilson, Mar 03, 1828 - Sep 17, 1845.

W....., Initials (M.E.W., No Dates, probably a footstone for a lost or moved 
headstone.)<br/>

Due to the excessive growth of vegetation this site has become nearly unrecognizable 
today (2016)<br/>
There are unknown graves here known only by our creator.<br/>

The Old Salem cemetery 
is located on Philip Thomason's farm, just to the south of the pond on the hill, 
but to the south-west of
his house. (1990). This is on Red Oak Road<br/>
about 3/4 mile west of the Boonshill 
Church &amp; Cemetery. Of course as stated the original Salem Church 
Congregation was 
nearby. It is apparent that there will be Wilson graves<br/>
here. the Boone 
Wilson Cemetery is located 700 yards to the west of this place, but Andrew  
or Ann Wilson does not show up in that listing.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>It is 
located on Red Oak Road and that concrete building nearby that is a church 
building was the black congregation, also a Cumberland Presbyterian Church. I 
(John) 
remember when the black congregation still met there. They 
disbanded around 25 to 30 years ago. <br/>
The old Salem building abandoned in 1892 is no longer there. It stood a good 
ways off the road. I (John) was told that it was a log structure.  If you can see a 
small pond south of Red Oak Road across the field at a fence row, back southeast 
of the black congregation block building that is about where it was. Across the 
fence is wooded area now. When last there 5 or 6 years ago I could not even find the markers. I was trying to show some of the Wilson family where it is.  
This was in the summer when everything was grown up in weeds and 
grass. I didn't want to
stomp around too much for fear of snakes. I think it was around 1990 when I was 
there and recorded the marker information above.</b></p>
