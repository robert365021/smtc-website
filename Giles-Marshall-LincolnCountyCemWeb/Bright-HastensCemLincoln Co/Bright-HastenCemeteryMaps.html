Location: From 
Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64 and turn south (left) on Old Elkton Pike (273). 
Follow that to Old Molino Road and turn left and follow that to Luttrell Rd and 
turn right. After that road takes a northward bend go another 4 tenths of a mile 
and turn left (east). That road dead ends on John Campbell Road and turn left 
(south) there and after the road bends back west go another 1/2 mile to the bend 
in the road back south and you will see large farm silos on the right. the cemetery is in a 
field to the west of those silos under a giant irrigation system. Follow the 3rd 
irrigation machine tire track from the road to the cemetery to avoid disturbing 
the crops. When wheat is growing in the winter follow the tracks to the cemetery 
and there will be no brush in the cemetery. Since the machines indivertibly fertilize the 
cemetery in the summer the weeds grow giant and it will be 
impossible to penetrate those or even to cut them down to view the cemetery, so 
yes this is presently a winter time visit. Corn is grown in the summer and is 
very tall making it hard even to find the cemetery.<br>

I have attempted to outline the cemetery with a yellow highlighter in the above 
map. Take this as only an estimation of the area.<br>
