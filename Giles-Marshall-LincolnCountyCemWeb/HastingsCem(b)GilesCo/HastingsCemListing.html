<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">According to Mrs. Joe Butler (c1986), the listings above without dates or 
tombstone photos are buried here.&nbsp; They are in unmarked graves or graves 
marked by a fieldstone.<br>
This publication was developed by starting with a listing from the book 
Giles County Cemeteries and adding or combining the inscriptions from the two photos of 
the stones which looked as if these were unique to the first listing. <br>
Deviations in the spelling of Hastings/Hasting/Hasten/Hastins are probably just 
errors related to illiteracy which is common for rural people of olden times 
including the tombstone inscribers. </font></p>
