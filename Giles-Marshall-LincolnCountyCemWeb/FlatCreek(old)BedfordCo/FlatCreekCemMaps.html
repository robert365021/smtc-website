From Shelbyville, take S. Main Street, which becomes Kingree Road, which is Hwy 82, 
south about 7 miles to Flat Creek. Turn left (or east) on Hill Top road and 
go about 1/3 mile and turn right into the residential road and cross the creek on the 
private bridge. Go to the end of the road also doubling as a residential road to a 
private house. With permission, to avoid alarming the resident, stop at the end 
of that drive and go into the gate steering clear of the cattle. Climb the 
hill and across another fence into the cemetery a distance of about 75 yards. The second fence may not have a 
gate.</font></b></span><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS"><b> If you are not a 
physical person I would not advise this trip. The climb up the hill, crossing 
fences and negotiating the surrounding cattle is no small task. Also when I 
visited the residential owner had several mean dogs to deal with, even though 
most of them were fenced. The mild mannered dogs were free.&nbsp; You 
can likely pet your way by them, however when the mean ones get stirred up the 
mild ones want to turn vicious too. Generally if you stand your ground and talk 
tough you will be OK. However, Getting all that taken care of in advance of your 
visit is much better. You will find the parking to be within 50 yards of the 
house and farm facilities which I am sure is not a comfortable issue for the 
land owner nor you the visitor, so you must deal with the landowner. </b></font>

</font></b></span><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS"><b> This old cemetery is cut 
off from a easy entry today. It is 3 or more acres and was at one 
time a very public type cemetery serving Flat Creek. The mapped access (probably the 
legal right of way) is from the north as described above. That lack of an 
entrance is very noticeable from this map. To me the shortest route 
from a road would be from a southwestern access from a road that travels 
east/west from Old Flat Creek Road (which is also likely to be a  
private drive). Leaving that road &amp; going northeast no more than 120 feet one 
would be into the Cemetery without the steep hills and parking in someone's 
yard. I am sure that route has 
about as much support from the locals involved as pulling teeth though.<br>
This cemetery was surveyed by starting from the north edge and going south on 
the eastern side of the rectangular shaped area. Next back toward the southwest 
corner where the Hale Family Cemetery is located. The surveyor then left that 
going back northward on the western side as the stones 
were found back to the north edge of the cemetery where I finished up. Another 
way of saying that is that I covered the eastern side of the cemetery first, 
then the Hale Family Cemetery, then the western side of the cemetery. <br>
There are 
a few more stones that are on the ground and covered and therefore were missed by me, 
but some were found by prior researchers, However I found some stones that they 
missed too so each survey has it own strengths. However, there also may be other 
inscribed stones that neither survey has found. </b></font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
