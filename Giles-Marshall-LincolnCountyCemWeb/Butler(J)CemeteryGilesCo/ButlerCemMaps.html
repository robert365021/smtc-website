Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski and when you get to Tarpley turn west (or right) 
and Prospect Road. Go a few miles and cross the creek and look for a residential 
lane into an old house place. The cemetery is straight into this lane at the end 
of what is labeled Petty Lane, but you will not see public road signs. The 
cemetery is just this side of an old garage/barn and under the trees. It was 
lightly kept up when I was there. <br>
