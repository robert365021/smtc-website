</b></font></font><b><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS">From Pulaski go north on Highway 31 about 4 miles, but first you will pass 
Industrial Loop Road, then Guthrie Rd/Pigeon Roost Rd &amp; lastly pass Annie White 
Road all on the left. After another mile you will see the home a white siding 
house for what is today the Archie Williams &amp; wife farm, a country cattle farmer. 
This is on 
your left upon the slope. This used to be the home of the William &amp; Mary (Myers) 
Reynolds, but not sure if the home is new. Archie is the current caretaker of the Judge Lee farm, 
the Tinnon (white) &amp; Myers (black) Cemeteries. The Shadden (also white) Cemetery also is on 
this place, but far back into the woodland. If your intentions are honorable Archie 
or his wife can allow or accompany you to either the recent Myers or the very 
old Tinnon cemetery. The Myers Cemetery resides about 250 yards behind Archie's home 
in front of the Alexander Tinnen Cemetery next to the field road to these two 
cemteries. Archie's wife's is the daughter of William &amp; Mary A (Myers) Reynolds parents &amp; 
the Myers as grandparents are interred in the Myers Cemetery. Myers 
Cemetery is near the front of the field road and the Tinnon Cemetery is back 
from that about 30 yards. This is all back southwest of their home. I was informed 
by Archie that because of the rocky nature of the soil there will be no further burials in the 
Myers Cemetery.<br>
