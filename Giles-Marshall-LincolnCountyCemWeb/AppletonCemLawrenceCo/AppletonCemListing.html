<p><b>* The above hand made &amp; 
initialed stones were hard to read and decipher.<br>
<br>
I saw one or two granite monuments, likely to be recent burials. I missed them due to the dense brush. I spotted them on
<br>
the walk around review, but failed to see them again inside the cemetery.<br>
Most of the above folks died before the slavery ended. It is my opinion all of 
the stones marked were slave owners or freedman if the census measured all that. <br>
<br>
&quot;People who have lived in the area for many years 
tell us that many slaves were buried here. Also, there were soldiers buried 
here <br>
who were killed during a skirmish of the Civil war. There are no known records 
of the <br>
names of these soldiers&quot;(2). According to the Census the Appleton's &amp; Kennamere's 
were Caucasian though there are no labels on that until 1880 when they were all 
deceased.</b></p>
<p><b>This abandoned cemetery
is in the middle of a field about 500 feet east of the Dobbins Cemetery. It is 
covered 
with Privy hedge, honeysuckle vines and saw briars. People who have lived in the area for 
many years 
tell us that many slaves were buried here (in the same cemetery as their slave 
owners). Also, there were soldiers buried 
here <br>
who were killed during a skirmish of the Civil war. There are no known records 
of the 
names of these soldiers. </b></p>

(1) Robert Wesley Appleton is listed as owning 14 slaves in the 1860 census of 
Lawrence County, Tennessee. He was made postmaster of Sugar Creek from August 
12, 1839 until January 16, 1858. It was then changed to Appleton Post Office 
with him remaining postmaster until October 30, 1860. The post office was said 
to have been in his home during all this time. R W's estate settlement can be 
found in Lawrence County Tennessee. He owned around 1200 acres of land.

This cemetery needs further research to determine these people's heritage. It 
also needs someone to care for the grounds at least twice a year - WA 25 Feb
