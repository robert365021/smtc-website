son of David Gilbert and his third wife who is believed to be named Mary O'Neal. 
Thomas married Amy Reed, daughter of Thomas and Reed.<br>
<br>
As a young man of 37, Thomas was shot and killed by Dr. Theo Westmoreland in 
what was purported to be an argument arising from a business arrangement 
involving the buying or selling of mules. Family lore passed down through the 
Westmoreland family had Thomas as being the aggressor, and Dr. Theo arming 
himself in self-defense and eventually firing the first shot.<br>
<br>
Alabama Record #209 p 84 says Apr. 27, 1869. Dr. Theo Westmoreland was indicted 
for the murder of Thos. H. Gilbert, Esq.<br>
The Athens Post on 31 Apr 1869 carried an announcement that Dr. Theophilus 
Westmoreland was Acquitted of the murder of Major Thomas Gilbert. <br>
The above information on the shooting is compliments of Martha Easter, a Gilbert 
family descendant. <br>
