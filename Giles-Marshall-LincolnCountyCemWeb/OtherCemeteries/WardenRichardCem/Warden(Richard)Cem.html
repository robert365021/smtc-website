Here are my notes on Richard Warden, not sure they are the same person because 
of the age difference?<br>
<br>
1850 US Federal Census Richard Warden 38 living with his mother Mary Warden 67; 
Eliza Warden 35; Priscilla Warden Kerr 28 and her son Joseph Kerr 5. 22 Oct 1850 
by J. A. Ramsey <br>
<br>
1860 US Federal Census District 6, Culleoka, Maury, Tennessee: Richard Warden 
52, merchant, value of property $4,000, living with the John and Eliza Ballafant 
family. 07 Jul 1860 by D. C. Scott<br>
<br>
1870 US Federal Census District 13, Bufords Station, Giles, Tennessee: Richard 
Warden 63, clerk in store, value of property $4,000; John T. Kerr 23, clerk in 
store, value of property $400. 29 Jul 1870 by Robert J. Anderson<br>
<br>
1880 US Federal Census District 13, Giles, Tennessee: Richard Warden 73, dry 
goods clerk; John Kerr 35, nephew, dry goods merchant and J. Putnam 20, dry 
goods clerk, boarder.<br>
<br>
We have almost absolutely proven that Richard Warden trained his nephew John T. 
Kerr, son of Thomas B. Kerr &amp; Mary Ann Warden of McNairy Co to take over his dry 
goods store sometime after 1870. John T. Kerr finished his life there and died and is 
buried in the Lynnwood Cemetery.<br>
<br>
It is known that Richard Warden is buried on his farm in Wales Station (actually 
he shows up as owning a home a couple miles south of Campbellsville on what is 
now Big Dry Creek Rd in Giles County, partly according to the book Autobiography 
by G.C. Brewer, his great nephew.<br>
<br>
<font color="#000080">Giles County Genealogy in Newspapers (abt)1870 - 1899:<br>
&quot;Died, at his residence on Dry Creek, near Salem Church, on Saturday, July 9th 
1881. At 10 o'clock a.m. of disease of the bladder, Mr. Richard Warden, aged 74 
years. For some time he has been managing the mercantile business for his 
nephew, Mr. John T. Kerr, for a while at Campbellsville, and lately at Buford's 
Station, and was highly esteemed throughout the entire community. He had never 
married.&quot;<br>
So we know he died on Dry Creek (big) near Salem Church. That is south of 
Campbellsville less than 2 miles. He affiliated with the Campbellsville 
community, since he was a mercantile business person there and in Buford 
Station. Might I assume he was buried in Campbellsville Cemetery in an unmarked 
grave? No says G.C. Brewer in his book refutes that. He said he was buried on his 
family farm. Could that still could be Salem Church. However that was a 
Methodist Church and it is not likely the Christian Church folks would be buried 
in a Methodist graveyard. I am going with the family burial on his farm 
information as the most plausible location. C. Wayne Austin, 2010<br>

<b>Warden, Richard</b><br>
Died, at his residence on Dry Creek, Giles county, Tennessee on the 9th of July 
1881 in the 75th year of his age, our highly esteemed brother, Richard Warden. 
Bro. Warden was never married. Was engaged for quite a number of years as a 
teacher in our common schools. Had followed the mercantile business a good 
portion of his time, in both of which he was successful. Brother Warden was 
among the first to embrace the ancient order of things, in the community where 
he lived, was immersed in Fountain Creek in 1836 (Campbells Station) by Bro. 
Hopwood; was a firm advocate of the ancient order till his death. He was patient 
under his affliction expressing himself as willing and ready to go, having 
finished his work. He was decided in his convictions, frank and easy to 
approach, disliked affection no matter where it was found, kind and tender 
hearted, ever ready to assist the suffering and distressed. Thus has passed away 
one beloved by his relatives, esteemed by his brethren and respected by his 
acquaintances.<br>
