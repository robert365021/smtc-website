<p align="center"><u>Commentary from the surveyor<br>
<br>
</u>I tried to get permission to visit this cemetery on 5 Nov 2009 by was met by 
vicious dogs when I drove up the driveway. What do you do? Risk awaking a night 
shift worker, by blowing your horn? Being a polite southerner, I chose to drive 
away, but was able to get a distant photo of the cemetery from the public road. 
I got out and quickly snapped the photo. The same dogs stormed down the hill and 
came at me to attack, but I was quick enough to scramble back into the safety of 
my car. I cringe to think what the outcome of this would have been if an 
innocent lady pushing a baby stroller came down that road.&nbsp; Well, it is 
clear to me that vicious dogs must be restrained, at least behind fences.<br>

<u>Writings and tales of folks buried in the Allen 
- Carpenter Cemetery</u><br>
As told to Debra by her past family members.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">T</span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #800080">here 
were&nbsp; 3 lost graves in this cemetery that I (Debra) am aware of.&nbsp; When 
Civil War Union soldiers were present this story as told by my Cousin, in her 
80s said; they (soldiers) took everything, they could, food, blankets, etc. 
typical of an invading army.<br>
Sadly this incident took place on the soldiers watch. A little black boy, was 
told by the soldiers to get upon a table and dance. While that in itself was no 
crime, they wouldn't let the child down,&nbsp; but she said that the child 
literally danced on that table until he collapsed. It was thought by all that he 
danced himself to death. This story was passed down to her from my 
Great-Grandparents. The second person an unknown older black man,&nbsp; who 
lived on the farm and worked here for sustenance is interred here also. He was 
probably not paid that much, but was fed, and had a place to sleep. When he 
passed away he was also buried here.&nbsp; The third, a white baby with a name 
which sounded something like Sturgeon, but I cannot say for sure. She named the 
parents as well. I will get you that information if possible. The baby was born 
5 months premature, and most likely stillborn. The family dug a small grave for 
the baby where Mary Ann is buried above her casket and had a small service, 
although she said there was no name. Their graves of the two blacks were then 
marked by common stones right next to the fence. She saw those as a child. The 
stones may be gone now.</span></p>
