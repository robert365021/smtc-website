<b>TAYLOR, Dr. Gilbert</b></p>
<p align="left">

Birth: Nov. 18, 1791 - Death: Aug. 6, 1870,&nbsp; Pulaski Giles 
County, Tennessee<br>
<br>
Summarized from the Pulaski Citizen August 12, 1870 and August 19, 1870<br>
<br>
Dr. Gilbert Taylor died at his residence in this city on Saturday night, 6th 
instantly, at 11 o'clock. The fatal disease was inflammation of the bowels.<br>
<br>
Dr. Taylor was born in Orange County, VA on November 18, 1791 in the same house 
in which his relative, President Zachary Taylor was afterwards born. He was 79 
years old at the time of his death.<br>
<br>
Dr. Taylor studied medicine in his native county and attended lectures in 
Philadelphia. He came to Pulaski in 1811, and recalled the cane that grew on 
most of the present site of the<br>
town. With the other pioneers of the town, he commenced life's journey. He 
started practicing medicine upon his arrival in Pulaski and soon had an 
extensive practice.<br>
<br>
When the War of 1812 came he responded to the first call for volunteers. He was 
appointed surgeon of his regiment, and also received the appointment of Staff 
Surgeon for Gen.<br>
Jackson. He served through the Creek campaign with Gen. Jackson. At the 
memorable crossing at the Battle of Emuckfau, when Col. Stump and his cavalry 
became demoralized<br>
by the charge of the Indians in the rear, Dr. Taylor was one of the twenty-five 
men that defended the ford until the infantry, with the help of the artillery, 
could re-cross. Eighteen<br>
out of the twenty-five men of this noble band were shot down. His coolness and 
bravery on this occasion called for the commendations of his General.<br>
<br>
On September 2, 1817, in the City of Pulaski, he married Miss Delia McCormack 
who survives him.<br>
<br>
In 1814, he made a profession of religion and in 1819 he was ordained a minister 
of the M. E. Church. He has been an able, faithful and efficient minister of the 
church. His deep<br>
sympathy with the afflicted, his pastoral visits to the sick, and his 
affectionate interest in their spiritual interest, knew no bounds and greatly 
endeared him to all. He was one of<br>
nature's noble men, possessed of a well balanced mind, courteous in his manners, 
kind and warm hearted in his feelings, frank, independent and conscientious in 
all the relations of<br>
life, he was a devoted husband, and affectionate father. He had a great aversion 
to show and when giving directions about his burial a few days before his death, 
he said he had lived as<br>
a plain unostentatious man through life and he wished to be buried in that 
manner; he wanted no eulogistic remarks at his grave.<br>
<br>
Dr. Taylor had been a member of the Masonic fraternity for 58 years. Thus has 
passed another of the early pioneers of our county. With his death, much of the 
unwritten history<br>
of our county and the thrilling events of frontier life is now lost.<br>
<br>
Dr Taylor was found living in Pulaski in the 1870 census (11 Jun 1870) with his 
wife Delia and Erasmus Taylor age 31 and Annie Taylor age 27. Dr Taylor was 
listed as a minister of the Gospel (but he was also a physician.)<br>

<i><b>As printed in the GILES COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY BULLETIN 
Apr 2013. It is unknown where Dr Taylor was laid to rest, The old City Cemetery 
has no listing for him. Neither did I find one in the Maplewood Cemetery Gi Co 
Cemetery book. So likely his conservative wishes were carried out and no 
gravestone was set. [C.W.Austin 27 Apr 2013] </b></i>
