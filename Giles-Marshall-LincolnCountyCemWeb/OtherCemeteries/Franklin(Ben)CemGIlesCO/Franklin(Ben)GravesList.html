<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="#800000">The census records show 
Ben Franklin family as next door neighbor of the William Samuel family. Today 
there is an old abandoned cemetery named Franklin that is back in the woods west 
of the Samuel family cemetery also accessible from Firetower Road. It is highly 
likely to be the graves of many in the family of Ben &amp; 1st wife Sarah including&nbsp; 
the 2nd wife America Franklin. The graves I am told by the Giles County Cemetery 
book are marked only with fieldstones without an inscription. Ben Franklin is 
however interred in the Maplewood Cemetery and probably thus so because he was 
living in Pulaski with his daughter in the latter part of his 91 years.</font></b></p>

This Ben Franklin family was Family #794 in Dist 11 of Giles County 1860. This 
was next door to the Samuel family who were Family #795. There is an old 
unmarked Franklin Cemetery just west of Fire-tower Road back in the woods with 
stones without any inscription. Since my efforts to find more of this family 
listed in graveyards of Giles County have failed I have to concluded they are 
buried in this lost Franklin cemetery in unmarked graves. Perhaps buried there 
are some of the children of Ben &amp; Sarah Franklin that died in their home in Dist 11 
along with possible earlier generations such as the grandfather and parents 
mentioned below. Statement says that Ben came to Giles Co with his grandfather 
Abraham Franklin not mentioning the parents. You will see the proximity of the 
Samuel Cemetery and the Franklin Cemetery on the Mapping.<br>
I searched the DG Beers property Survey in 1876 and did not find the Franklins 
In 1880 Ben was living alone so he was probably missed. the Samuels that show up 
are W.J. Samuel and Mrs R.C. Samuel. We know there are already errors here and 
in the Samuel family. W.J. is probably William S. Samuel and Mrs R.C. Samuel is 
a mystery for now so that census is inconclusive. The Franklin family may have 
had their home fronting the next westerly road which is Odd Fellows Hall. While 
today that is further away from the cemetery than Fire-Tower road there is a 
home place in the hollow I am sure a spring or dry branch flows out of the high 
ground of that hollow I will call here Franklin because it should thus be named 
on Topography Maps. When I went there to the modern Brick home no one appeared 
to be home. The family number is not so close after 1860 indicating that the 
census taker seperater the Odd Fellows Hall R. from Fire-tower Rd. Nevertheless 
that does not change the distance between the households.<br>

This cemetery was not surveyed. It is so far off the road on private land back 
upon a hill and there being no marked stones I am using my research of mapping 
and census records the follow on as to who is interred here. Giles County 
Cemetery book page 137 says there are only fieldstone marked graves here. It is 
my hope that the Franklin family will appreciate the significance of locating 
where their ancestors lived and are buried. C. Wayne Austin 28 May 2016. It is 
my hope that someone can finish the job I am doing in locating the graves of all 
the people who were buried in Giles County.</i></b></font></p>
