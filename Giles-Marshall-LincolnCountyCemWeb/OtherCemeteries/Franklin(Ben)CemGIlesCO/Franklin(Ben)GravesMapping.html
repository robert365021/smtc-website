Go out Hwy 31 Alt Northeast toward Lewisburg/I-65 to the first left turnoff&nbsp; 
to Fire-tower Road. There is a service road back to the large Farm Operation on 
your left. Turn there after you determine the owner and with that permission 
follow that road until it bends back to the left (southwest) and park your 
vehicle out of the way. This will be nearly up next to the northern most long 
building, but stay out of the way of large trucks coming and going here. Follow 
the visible field road north (to your right) going up the slope into the woods. 
When the field road bends back left (or west) continue and the cemetery is on 
the right (north) side of that field road about 220 yards west of where the road 
first bent westward. <br>

This aerial view shows the cemetery in relation to the large farm buildings and 
field roads needed. You must secure permission. You will naturally encounter 
stiff security restrictions here as given by government guidelines in regards to 
the food supply chain. I cannot guarantee the cemetery is on the same property 
as the farming operation.<br>
