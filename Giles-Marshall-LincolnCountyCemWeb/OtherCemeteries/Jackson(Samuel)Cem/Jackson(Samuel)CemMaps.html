  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Near the state line on the west 
        side of Hulsey Branch Road on a hill under the trees. Directions: Take 
        Highway Hwy 11 south past Minor Hill and turn left or east into Hulsey 
        Branch Road and go past the entrance to Jackson Clinic Road aka 
        called Davis Hill Road. The cemetery is across the road from the Cletus 
        White home on the west side? of the creek in a thicket. [CWA,

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery more clearly in the tree line just a 
        few hundred yards north of the Alabama/Tennessee state line. At least we believe this is within 500 yards of the exact 
        location, but now believe it is on the west side of the creek. The land 
		owner's name is Ralph McCurry and he lives at Minor Hill. I have the big 
		yellow arrow where I think this cemetery is located and where I have 
		plotted the GPS as there. However, there is a minor smaller arrow that I 
		think the cemetery may be instead where it can be found. </font></b><br>
