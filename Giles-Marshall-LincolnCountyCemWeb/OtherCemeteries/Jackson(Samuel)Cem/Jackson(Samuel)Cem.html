<p><b>JACKSON, Nichles</b>, (Only inscription found in this 
cemetery - no dates or other information present, born sometimes prior to 1797. 
Has&nbsp; a younger brother Barrington Jackson, who is interred in the Jackson Cemetery 
northeast of here. (Nichles is believed to be a misspelling of Nicholas)&nbsp;

<p><b>THOMAS, James F.</b>* 1834 &quot;died in a hospital, March 
13th 1862.&quot;.&nbsp; Confederate States Army, Company H, 32nd Tennessee Infantry. 
This was Captain Thomas Hanna's Company, called the Tennessee Volunteers. He was 
listed as a Waggoner and was promoted to Corporal. His widow was&nbsp; Louisa 
Caroline Marbut Thomas.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Others buried here</b> are thought to be the children of Nicholas Jackson. 
There were at least eight of them. Nicholas Jackson lived here and it is 
  believed his descendants are therefore buried here.<br>
<br>
*Credible sources say he is interred here in an unmarked grave, 
perhaps under one of the fieldstones. It is also known he may be interred in a 
field location somewhere in Kentucky resulting from his death during the Civil War. 
His story can be told in detail at this location:<a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~tngiles/cvlwar/thomas.html">
http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~tngiles/cvlwar/thomas.html</a> (a tremendous 
story as compiled and told by Jim Thomas a descendent and submitted to Anna Jackson 
of Rootsweb TNGILES)</p>
<p>This cemetery is laced with fieldstones without inscriptions marking the 
  head of graves of persons unknown.&nbsp; Image <a href="IMG_8160.jpg">8160</a> 
is what I (Lisa) think is a foot stone in the lower end of site. Other

  <p class="MsoNormal">The Sam Jackson Cemetery is mapped here and on Findagrave.com, 
but not 
  proven by a visit.

	What is known is that the Sam Jackson 
  Cemetery is located across from Cletus White's house on Hulsey's Branch Road 
  on a hill. It is grown up in brush, hard to find and difficult to get to. I went with 
  other parties to find it once, but gave up without success. Others since have 
  been successful in finding it, but were unable to add any more conclusions as 
  to who may be interred there. Several field rocks are still present.&nbsp; The only 
  rock with an inscription has inscribed on it Nichles Jackson. He would have been born 
  sometimes before 1797. The other Jackson Cemetery 
  northeast of here was founded by a younger brother of this Nicholas Jackson buried 
  here. His name and listing: JACKSON, Bar<u>rigt</u>on, 20 Dec 1797 - 17 Sep 1868.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Nick's grandson, Samuel Andrew &quot;Sam&quot; 
  Jackson 1847-1902, lived her when he was killed in a mystery that still 
  stands today. This cemetery is named 
  after him. (See Samuel Andrew Jackson Findagrave.com (<a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=jackson&GSiman=1&GScid=15694&GRid=65005073&">http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=jackson&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=15694&amp;GRid=65005073&amp;</a>) Sam was buried in 
  the Minor Hill Cemetery.

  <p class="MsoNormal">I've been told James Washing Balch was 
  buried in the Nick Jackson cemetery too.&nbsp; I've wondered why since he lived no 
  where near here.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was able to find 
Nicholas Jackson's grave site. His stone is still standing and there are about 
20 field stones marking other graves.<br>
There was one smaller stone&nbsp; - maybe a foot stone, also standing in the 
lower end of the site. The head stone for that has likely fallen and is buried. 
I didn't have time or the tools to try to recover it.<br>
The remains of an old fence enclosing the site can still be seen. I would guess 
the site was half to three quarters of an acre. It is on the hill side and all 
inside woodland now. <br>
The coordinates are 35.00.04 -87.10.35 . <br>
Image <a href="IMG_8148.jpg">8148</a>, <a href="IMG_8150.jpg">8150</a> &amp;
<a href="IMG_8168.jpg">8168</a> are all N. Jackson's stone.<br>
Image <a href="IMG_8160.jpg">8160</a> is what I think is a foot stone in the 
lower end of site. (I think this is a partially carved stone whereby we are not 
clear whether it is a footstone or headstone, CWA 5 May 2014)<br>
Image <a href="IMG_8170.jpg">8170</a> is a large beech tree on the left of the 
trail and the graves are behind the tree.<br>
Image <a href="IMG_8173.jpg">8173</a> is beside the barn looking toward the 
site.<br>
Image <a href="IMG_8172.jpg">8172</a> going pass the barn toward the hill. You 
follow the trail on the up side of the hill into the woods. <br>
All other images are examples of the field stones marking other graves. I was 
not expecting that many other graves.<br>
The land owner's name is Ralph McCurry and he lives at Minor Hill. Hope this 
helps. Take care. Lisa<br>
