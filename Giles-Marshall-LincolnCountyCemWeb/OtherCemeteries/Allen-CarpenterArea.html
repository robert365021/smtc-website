PULASKI, GILES COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br>

</b>We can see the Allen-Carpenter Cemetery&nbsp; upon the slop in the pasture
in a thicket. Not visible in this distant photo is the chain link fence
surrounding the cemetery. It seems in the south we put up fences and the
graveyards grow up in brush. No fence and the cattle destroy the cemetery.
Neither way works without constant intervention and care.<b><br>
