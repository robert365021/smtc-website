</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080">Location: Go out Hwy 31/11 Alt to 
Krapp Springs Road and turn right. When that dead ends into Sumac Road turn 
left. Go to the last house on the right before reaching New Zion Church &amp; 
Cemetery for permission. The cemetery is behind that house and behind the barns 
on the old Worsham place, but inside the white fence. This landowner values 
their privacy so permission will probably be denied. If you are a descendent of 
this cemetery use the legal &amp; law community for visitation here. If you go here 
without accompaniment you will be denied entrance by a locked gate.&nbsp; 
However,&nbsp; you may be lucky enough to find someone who is in good graces of 
this landowner for securing permission. Good luck. The landowner seems to be 
taking relatively good care of this cemetery. However, there are some stones 
that are fallen and in need of being set back up or repaired The William &amp; Sarah 
Samuel stone is face down.
