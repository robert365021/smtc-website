					Pulaski Citizen 22 Apr 1915<br>
					</u><br>
					William James Samuel died Saturday at his home at Sumac aged 
					about 75 years. Funeral services were conducted at the 
					residence by Revs. Will Nelson and L. H. Laten, followed<br>
					by the burial at Zion Ezell by his old comrades of the John 
					H. Woldridge Bivouac of which he was a member. Mr. Samuel 
					was as good a soldier as ever shouldered a gun during<br>
					the civil strife of the 60's and was a member of the First 
					Tennessee Regiment, Capt. Field's Company, later Capt W. C. 
					Flournoy's. He was wounded at Chickamauga and also at<br>
					the last battle with Hood at Nashville. The wounds gave him 
					pain as long as he lived. Mr. Samuel was a splendid type of 
					the highest citizenship and was revered for his nobility<br>
					of character. His wife died some years ago and surviving him 
					are the following children: Mesdames Lillie Thompson of 
					Lewisburg, Grace Estes of Virginia, and Mrs. Eslick of Sumac 
					and <br>
					Will Samuel of Decatur.<br>
