<b>The large number of unaccounted for memorials (5 ea) 
can probably be explained by a couple of large tree falling along the main row 
of graves. I am certain some of the memorials were flattened by these trees and 
hopefully once these trees rot these stones may turn up again but likely they 
will be broken or crushed and need serious repair. Also in this situation they 
may be pushed below the ground level.</b><br>

**The parentage of this John Crockett b. 
1780 North Carolina remains a unknown to careful researchers. I have studied Ancestry.com 
charts and there is no consistency in his parentage out there. Some have him as 
a son of Archibald with no back up info. Others have him as a son of John (a 
brother of Davy), but still little evidence to show. Still others have other 
parentage. I hope the DNA can prove his parentage. The family trees on Ancestry.com leaves something to be desired. They are just raw names no dates and little 
info in most cases. My ancestor Robert Crocket b. 1746 living last (&amp; 
died) in Giles County (nearby county) shows some similarities to being kin. 
Robert had a brother named David Crockett who traded land and last lived &amp; died in Bibb County 
Georgia. This David willed land to his nephew Archibald Crockett b. 1764, 
Archibald was son of Robert Crockett b. 1746 of Giles County. Fat chance because the records include lots of Georgia Crocketts'. That 
Georgia southern migration route became one of the alternate southern movements to spread the settlers 
westward instead of the Cumberland Gap or floating down the Tennessee River, 
Cumberland River, Duck River, Elk River or even some were so fool hardy as to 
climb over peaks that had no cliffs as high as 1,000 feet. The Cumberland Gap 
was 400 feet high. Anyway the Archibald &amp; Robert Crockett's of Giles Co are also 
natives of North Carolina. </b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: 700">To be a little clearer on this 
Robert's brother David, whose wife was Elizabeth, went to GA around 1786 where 
he died ca 1830 leaving some Bibb Co, GA land to nephew Archibald who was 
residing in Giles Co, TN when he (Archibald) sold it. David appears to have left 
no children so that no children situation is a problem too. I did notice Samuel 
J. named one son Archy in this census treatise below (1870). One wing of the 
Crocketts in the America (North &amp; South Carolina Crocketts) used the name 
Archibald or &quot;Archy&quot; lots of times. That is a minor hint along with the fact 
that Robert &amp; Archibald were both born in Mechlenburg NC or at least lived there 
at one time. This matches up to John also.</span></p>

This graveyard was located on the original farm of John &amp; 
Mary Cowan Crockett, and in later times on or at least near the son John S. Crockett's  
family farm. Also a brother Samuel &amp; Ameila Austell Crockett had a family graveyard 
on their nearby farm where they laid 
some of their children to rest, but they themselves chose to be buried in the Cumberland Presbyterian Churchyard Cemetery when family cemeteries faded in use. 
Where are the graves of (son) John S. &amp; Charlotte Crockett? They remained here 
on the land best I can tell from the censuses. Graves unmaked.<br>
This is a beautiful setting with the mountains highlighted in the eastern 
background and fertile valley lands around you. Other owners Mr. Breashears owned it now Mr. Myers 
is the owner.</p>
