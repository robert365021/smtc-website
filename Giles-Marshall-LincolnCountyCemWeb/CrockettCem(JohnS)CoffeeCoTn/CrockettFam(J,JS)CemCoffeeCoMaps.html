This map shows the GPS coordinates of the John Crockett Family Cemetery as N 35.38747 
X W -85.91225.&nbsp;Southeast of Stephenson on the old Crockett farm, now owned 
by Sam Brashear (historical). Now owned by Mr. Myers. Plotting this from the old Topo Maps yields the 
GPS marker at the southeast area of this tree lined forest. His home is 1/4 mile 
and just in front of the cemetery on the road.<br>

Coming from Nashville I-24 exit on Hillsboro Highway (#41) exit 114 and go to 
the Bailey Road. Turn left (east) and follow that and it will become Stephenson 
Road. After about three miles and just past Sam Brashears Road on the right the 
road curves to the right. with permission from there look east (left) out into the big field at 
the distant thicket of trees. The Cemetery is in the south east quad (that is on 
your far right) of that thicket. You 
will see a field road out to that thicket next to the neighbors tree line, but be sure the crop is not 
going to be trampled by you. You can walk if there are fresh crops in force and 
not drive. To drive there it must not be in the wet season or you will bog down 
or at the very least cause deep groves in the field ruining the growth of crops.<br>

This photo looks at the cemetery showing the thicket where the cemetery resides. 
Go here prepared to stay clear of brush and other hazards, but this thicket is 
easy to navigate in the winter time as there is not much undergrowth to contend 
with. If we continue to have wet summers the foliage will become very dense. Be prepared and careful. These places 
are not for the faint of heart 
and body, especially in the summer with active heat, chiggers and ticks. With heavy 
boots the snakes are safe to deal with though. Chiggers become dormant below 60 
degrees and snakes about the same. Ticks can be a little more hardy, but slow 
down in winter.<br>
