<b>SANDERS, John W.</b>, 17 May 1828 - 10 Jul 1879. 
(stone lying beside trunk of large nearby tree. I think it may be misplaced. 
There is a small base about the right size to be his inside the fence)

<b>SWINEBROAD, Henry</b>, Cir 1795 - Cir 1845 (age and death based on the 1840 
and 1850 censuses; no grave can positively be identified as his. but this was 
his farm and family.)<br>
<b>SWINBROAD, Elvira</b>, 1806 -&nbsp; (cir 1855) (Listing her here is more 
precarious. Did she go to Texas with her son and die there, but based on the 
census she was  
deceased by 1860 making that not likely.)<br>
