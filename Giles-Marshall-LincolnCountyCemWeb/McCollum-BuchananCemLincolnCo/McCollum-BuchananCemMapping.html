Location: From 
Fayetteville go northwest on Hwy 431 a few miles and turn left at Howell onto 
Shields Road. Follow that 1/3 mile to Brown Teal Road and turn right then back 
left on Round Square Road. When Round Square Road starts to bend back right or 
north look to your left for the field/farm road which doubles as a road back to 
the cemetery. At the end look to your right at the cemetery under the grove of 
trees behind the barn 100 yards away.&nbsp; With permission when at the end of 
the farm road go thru the 2 iron cattle gates on your right while still facing 
west, but to the left 
(west) of the barn. Be sure to close all gates behind you. Finally cross into 
the iron gate leading into the cemetery. The cemetery entrance gate is at the 
northwest corner of the cemetery.

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>This 
cemetery is well fenced but grown up in privet hedge, small &amp; giant trees and other growth. Some 
of the Moore monuments are near the entrance over from the gate. The McCollum 
monuments are in the south east quad of the cemetery and the Buchanan progenitor 
Mausoleum is in the center with the balance of the stones in the western area 
spanning along the north edge of the cemetery.<br>
