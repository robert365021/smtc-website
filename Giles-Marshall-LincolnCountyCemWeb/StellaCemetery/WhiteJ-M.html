	</b>County Citizen - Thursday, November 29, 1877 <br>
	Died James White, Esq., of Pleasant Hill neighborhood, died Saturday, 17th 
	instantly at an advanced age. He was the father of Dr. Thos. White, dec'd of 
	Pulaski. <br>
	Giles County Citizen Issue - Thursday, December 6, 1877<br>
	Tribute of Respect Died at his residence, Giles County, Tenn., Nov. 16th, 
	1877, James White, Esq. in his 84th year. Esq. White was born in the state 
	of Georgia in the year 1794. When a small boy, his father immigrated to 
	Middle Tennessee and settled in Sumner County near Gallatin. After remaining 
	there a few years, he moved with his family down the Cumberland River near 
	the site now Fort Donelson. Making but a short stay at this place, he 
	removed and located in Maury County.<br>
	When the subject of this notice had gained his 18th year, England again had 
	declared war against the United States. A call was made for volunteers to 
	beat back her threatening armies of invasion. He came to the call of His 
	Country; offered his services; entered the army, and marched with General 
	Jackson's Troops to New Orleans and there took part in that memorable battle 
	fought on the 8th of January, 1812, which achieved for us a second time our 
	independence of Great Britain and made us a free people. <br>
	After peace was negotiated, Esq. White returned to his home in Maury county 
	and re-entered school, and obtained for that day a good English education, 
	after which he taught school there until the spring of 1820. <br>
	He then came to Giles County and married Matilda Gooch, and lived with his 
	widowed mother-in-law (Mary E. Gooch), until the fall of the same year. He 
	then moved to himself, where he had choice of the forest to select timbers 
	to build his house, and here he lived in peace, prosperity and plenty for 
	fifty years. His family grew to six children, all of whom save two, preceded 
	him to the land of rest. <br>
	In the year 1827 (October), Esq. White, professed the religion of Christ at 
	a camp meeting occasion the first ever held at Pleasant Hill. He was at this 
	time a tenter and continued to be as long as such meetings were kept up at 
	this place and assisted to feed and entertain a liberal share of those who 
	assembled from year to year to worship. During the fifty years of his 
	Christian life, he with becoming diligence and zeal, worked for his Master. 
	His opportunities were not confined alone to revival seasons, Sabbath 
	schools, and prayer meetings to work for Christ, but often at the bedside of 
	the sick. Esq. White was an elder in the Pleasant Hill congregation, C. P. 
	Church, for about forty years. During his Christian warfare for a half 
	century, his deportment was blameless and without censure and the 
	brotherhood of his church.<br>
	During his last hours, an old friend of his and veteran of the cross and too 
	one of the noble old braves of the War of 1812, visited him (his neighbor 
	for about 40 years) and their separation, bidding each other farewell and 
	shaking hands for the last time on earth, was a scene touching indeed, 
	deeply affecting and profoundly solemn. <br>
	Esq. White was truly a good man and entertained for himself a high personnel 
	regard, and with commanding appearance and courteous bearing, he impressed 
	all with whom he met favorably. He was an officer for about forty years of 
	his life, and transacted a large amount of business for the public, both in 
	Church and State, and his sound judgment and equitable decisions engrafted 
	him in the esteem and confidence of those for whom he labored. Esq. White 
	was a true man in the bravest sense. He was true to his own conscience, true 
	to his family, true to his neighbor, true to his country, and true to his 
	God. His every aspect proclaimed him one of nature's purest and best man. In 
	his death we can truly say that his family has lost a discrete and wise 
	counselor, the church a faithful friend, and society a useful member. It was 
	his pleasure during his long life to visit the sick. This he did almost to 
	his death, and on becoming occasions would offer prayer in their behalf, and 
	at all time would encourage and comfort as far as was in his power. <br>
	During the two or three last years of his life, he was greatly distressed at 
	times with chronic rheumatism and in continence of urine, the latter more 
	particularly did exceedingly distress him. But with Christian patience bore 
	it all without murmuring, and was heard to say often that these troubles 
	would son have an end. And that the Lord had in reservation better things 
	for him-life, eternal life undisturbed by cares and pain, if he but proved 
	true and faithful to the end. This he did three days before his death being 
	more at himself mentally than at any time during his illness. The author of 
	this tribute went into his room and found none present with him except his 
	faithful and aged wife. We called to her and asked, &quot;How is Esquire now, 
	Grandma?&quot; She replied, &quot;He is happy and praising God the best his strength 
	has to do.&quot; &quot;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: 
	yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works 
	do follow them.&quot;<br>
