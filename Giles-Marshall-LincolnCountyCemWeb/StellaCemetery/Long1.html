	Mrs. Ella Long who lives near Stella, committed suicide by taking carbolic 
	acid. Mrs. Long was a consistent member of the Pleasant Hill Church, a true 
	and devoted mother and a loving and dutiful wife. How sad to lose a mother 
	and true companion, because we can not realize what a mother is worth until 
	we have lost her.<br>
	May the good Father who is always merciful console and comfort these little 
	ones and their father in the hour of their greatest sorrow. May they look 
	unto Him who is able to save to the utmost all who will put their trust in 
	Him.<br>
	Death is only a dream and some sweet day if you will only trust in Jesus you 
	shall meet your loved one in heaven-in that sweet home of the soul, where 
	you will never again be separated.<br>
	Funeral services were conducted by Rev. T. H. Porter, of Columbia, and her 
	remains were laid to rest in Pleasant Hill Cemetery.<br>
	She leaves a husband and three small children. A Friend. Stella, Tenn.<br>
