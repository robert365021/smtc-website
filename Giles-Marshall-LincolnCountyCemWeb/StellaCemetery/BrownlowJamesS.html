    Brownlow<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Home sweet home.&nbsp; How sweet and how pleasant it is to us when all things 
    are well.&nbsp; Often when I am alone I think of my youthful days and pleasantly 
    I spent them.&nbsp; But alas! death has entered and claimed one we loved.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; J. S. Brownlow was born Nov. 24, 1848, and married to Elizabeth Paisley 
    Sept. 9, 1869, who survives.&nbsp; To this union were born seven children, five 
    boys and two daughters, L. B. Brownlow, Ethridge, Tenn., Erskine, John and 
    William, of Prospect, Tenn., Mrs. J. M. Forsythe, Glendale, Tenn., one 
    daughter and one son had already gone home to God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; He has been a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church at Pleasant 
    Hill over fifty years and was one of its strongest supporters, having served 
    as elder a larger part of the time.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; He was made a Master Mason in which body he was a continuous member till 
    death.&nbsp; Mr. Brownlow's hospitality was unbounded and it was a great pleasure 
    to be in his home.&nbsp; He was extremely charitable to benevolence, always ready 
    to lend a helping hand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brownlow died March 10, 1928, age 79 years 3 months and 15 days and 
    was interred in Pleasant Hill Cemetery (sic - now Stella Cemetery - see GCT 
    Cem Bk, p.502) with Masonic honors in the presence of a large concourse of 
    sorrowing friends and relatives.&nbsp; Rev. W. S. Marshall conducted the funeral 
    services at the church.</div>
