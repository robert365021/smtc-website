Pleasant Hill), Stella, GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
  <br>
  KERR, Samuel, 2 Jul 1790 - 22 Apr 1881. (Son of James &amp; Nancy [Mitchell]
  Kerr who died in Maury County; husband of Anna Paisley Kerr interred in Mt
  Carmel Cemetery)<br>
  <br>
  </font><font size="2" color="#BB2206">Story goes that sometime after Samuel
  Kerr's wife Anna Paisley Kerr died Samuel heard a suspicious noise in his hen
  house. When he went to investigate he was confronted by a robber who shot him.
  Though he survived he was bedfast for a time and a neighborly single lady
  known first the records as Sarah Ball came to nurse him back to health.
  Sometime during or after Samuel mended they fell in love and married. However, Soon the marriage fell apart and Sarah
  moved back with her family. It is said she did so when she found out she was
  not substantially included in Samuel Kerr's will. We find Sarah Kerr as <a href="../KedronCemGilesCo/kerrSidney.html">Sidney
  S. Kerr</a> interred beside her family here in the Kedron Cemetery a few miles
  northeast of the Stella Cemetery.&nbsp;</font></b><i><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF"><br>
