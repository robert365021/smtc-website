	IRWIN, Jennie, Stone broken, born about 1879 (see 1880 census information 
	below; see p. 501 Giles County Tennessee Cemetery book; stone not found in 
	2009 survey)</b></p>
	<p align="center"><b>The 
	three listed above were members of the 1880 household of James R. Irwin and 
	wife Frances M. Dunnavant:<br>
	<br>
	Census Extraction - 1880: District 3, Giles, Tennessee:<br>
	<br>
	James Irwin 33; Francis Irwin 29; Charles C. Irwin 10; Ida E. Irwin 6; 
	Robert T. Irwin 4; Jennie R. Irwin 1<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	I believe (no proof) Francis probably died as result of childbirth in 1887 
	when her son Cephus was born. At some point after 1887 James R. Irwin moved 
	to Texas where he died 16 Jun 1914 and was buried in Eutaw Cemetery, 
	Limestone, TX. Robert T. Irwin, his wife and some of their children are 
	buried in Rice Cemetery, Navarro Co., TX. Interestingly, another son, Cyphus, 
	born 1887 -- (his mother likely died from childbirth) -- worked for 
	railroads and ended up in Decatur, Morgan, Al and is buried in Decatur City 
	Cemetery there.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Now, that more cemetery and census information is on-line it certainly helps 
	one to find these folks. I found James R. by tracking some of his maternal 
	cousins from the Col. David Rice Scott line. I�m not a Scott family 
	descendant but several of them intermarried with my Dunnavant, Hastings, 
	Hargrove/Hargrave, Holt, Meadows family members so I find it useful to track 
	most members of his descendants in order to find some of my brickwalls from 
	my other lines.<br>
	<br>
	Again, I sincerely appreciate all the countless hours you and your crew 
	expended in getting this valuable cemetery information posted on line. I 
	refer to it several times a day. I�ve even printed out several of the 
	cemetery enumerations so that I can use it when I�m not able to get on-line 
	(while waiting in doctor�s offices and labs during my 90-year old mom�s 
	appointments).<br>
