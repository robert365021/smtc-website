  </i>REV. J. M. ASHFORD<br/>
  <br/>
  The subject of this sketch was born in Giles County, Tenn., June 6, 1842. At 
  the early age of sixteen his convictions were so strong and well-defined that 
  he entered the ministry of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Brother Ashford 
  was a man who was not content to lead an inactive life. Temperamentally he was 
  disposed to hard work, and was never known to seek an easy pastorate. It was 
  his consuming desire to do great things for his Master, and in coveting large 
  opportunities for service, he counted no hardship too great in order that he 
  might be a workman who needed not to be ashamed.<br/>
  <br/>
  Brother Ashford held what many would call peculiar views. He would never allow 
  a merchant to give him a discount on purchases simply because he was a 
  minister. He never traveled on clerical permits, but always paid the regular 
  fare. He felt that the acceptance of such concessions cheapened the ministry.<br/>
  <br/>
  In point of ability he was recognized as beyond the average. Many churches in 
  Cumberlandism stand today as monuments to his zeal and efficiency. His 
  preaching was of that order that commanded attention and bore fruit. Many 
  preachers may have attained more prominence because of his modesty and 
  self-denying spirit. What concerned him most was to do the duty that lay the 
  nearest, and it mattered not to him whether doing that duty took him to the 
  high or lowly places.<br/>
  <br/>
  He was married to Miss Elizabeth Jordan, February 6, 1866. This was a happy 
  union which endured the privations, trials and cares of nearly half a century. 
  On account of ill health, he was compelled to resign his pastorate at 
  Goodlettsville, Tenn., in January, 1913, and later came to the Bowling Green 
  home to reside. He died at the home, September 14, 1913, his wife having 
  preceded him to the better land by a few weeks.<br/>
  <br/>
  The funeral services were conducted at the home by the writer, pastor of the 
  Cumberland Presbyterian Church, Bowling Green, Ky., and his body was carried 
  to Pleasant Hill, Tenn., where he was laid to rest by the side of his wife in 
  the old churchyard.<br/>
  <br/>
  Brother Ashford was a Mason of high degree, a Knight of Pythias, and an Odd 
  Fellow.<br/>
  <br/>
  In these brief statements is summed up the life and death of a good man. He 
  was faithful to the trust reposed in him, and the church and society are 
  better for his life. The grave is not the charnel house of our hopes. "Twould 
  be a dreary world indeed if this were so. Faith looks beyond the grave, and we 
  are confronted and sustained by a steadfast belief that we shall see our 
  friend again. Realizing this, if we knew that one word from us would bring him 
  back to the scene of his trials and sufferings, which of us would utter it?<br/>
  <br/>
  May the sod of old Tennessee, his native state, which he loved so well, press 
  lightly upon him as he sleeps his last sleep to awaken in the bosom of his 
  Lord.<br/>
  E. W. Barrington.<br/>
