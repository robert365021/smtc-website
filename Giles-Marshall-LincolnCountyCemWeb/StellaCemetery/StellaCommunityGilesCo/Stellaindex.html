     </u>STELLA VILLAGE&nbsp;<br>
     <br>
     <font size="2">
     As told by Bruce Cosby, one of her oldest citizens.&nbsp;<br>
     <br>
     Stella a quiet little community situated in the southwestern part of Giles County,
     Tennessee, was given its name by Dr. M. S. Waters, one of her most
     prominent early citizens. The name was chosen in honor of the sweetheart of
     Dr. Water's youngest son, David. The first settlement of Stella dates back
     to the middle of the 19th century. The first store in Stella was opened in
     the spring of 1868 with W. G. Inman from Aspen Hill as its first
     proprietor. A plot of land to be used for the first school ground and on
     which the present school building now stands was given by Mr. W. P.
     Paisley. Included in this plot was that to be used as a community cemetery
     just back of the school building. At that time, Mr. Paisley lived in the
     house now owned by Mrs. Mary Cosby. It was in this house that the first
     Post Office was opened. With the improvement of travel and mail service,
     this post office was discontinued and the people were served by a rural
     route from Bethel, Tennessee. Prominent names of those days in Stella were
     Tom Reagan, M. F. Hunter, who ran blacksmith shops, and Peter Kincaid who
     had charge of a saw mill located on the small stream which runs back of the
     present (1941) saw mill and store. The present building of the Cumberland
     Church was erected in 1865 and was served at that time by Reverend A. M.
     (Addison Mitchell) Kerr who lived in the house now occupied by Renzo C.
     Smith. Reverend Kerr also taught school in the old log church located just
     below the new church building. Dr. M. S. Waters was the doctor who served
     the people of Stella at that time. Dr. Waters was succeeded for a number of
     years by other members of his family. Dr. Water's family members were
     always prominent in the medical profession. As Stella advanced, J. D.
     Coffman, Sr., opened and ran a store just east of the present store site.
     Later a store and gin were opened and operated by J. H. Hagan and J. E.
     Chiles. J. H. Kerr opened and ran a store in the building in which Roy
     Davis now has a store. The first Methodist Church building was built in
     1872. H. Taylor Smith (for whom the Smith road is named) taught school at
     Stella, also known at one time as Pleasant Hill. The original plot given by
     Mr. Paisley has been retained as a school ground and the building now
     standing was erected on this plot in 1926. That is the place the original
     CP church building stood but which is now up the hill. Today (2004) the
     store last operated by Roy Davis is still standing. Modified and revised
