<p align="center">Standing in the Cemetery looking northwest at the old Stella
Cumberland Church. It is believed the James Paisley family being here as early
as 1815 might have been the initial founding family for this church. We know it
was meeting at least by the 1820s but not in this building
when the Samuel
Kerr moved here from Spring Hill in Maury County and married Anna Paisley
the daughter of James. The original&nbsp; structure was completed in
1868.&nbsp;We are unaware of the date this building was built but perhaps it is
the same building only modified in some respects such as doing away with the two
doors.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At one time this church was known as the Pleasant Hill Cumberland Church and the
members held worship services continuously, except during the Civil War, for one
hundred and fifty five years. This Church was organized late in the year 1818,
or early 1819 in the house of James Paisley, by Andrew Smith, a Circuit Rider.
The original organization consisted of six members namely: James Paisley, wife,
Hannah Paisley, daughters, Anna and Jane Paisley, mother-in-law, Mary Duck and
Mrs. Anna Noblet. James Paisley, being the only male member, was chosen ruling
elder, and served in this capacity the remainder of his life. Since there was no
house of worship, not even a schoolhouse suitable for religious worship in this
part of Giles County service was conducted in James Paisley's dwelling for about
twenty years. In 1837 a log house of worship was erected on the present Sacred
hill, In the Stella Community, the six acre site was given by Mr. Paisley. For
many years this Church was supplied with preaching by Circuit Riders, the
following is a partial list: Andrew Smith, Arthur Hicks, John Forbes, Bethel
Briant, William Wilkins, James Calhoun, Jonaes Sparks, William Kilpatrick,.
William Crawford, Armine Reece, William Ward,_Samuel_Russell, James McNut,
William Gracey Charles B. Porter, George Stockard and J. Parr. During that time
almost every year there was an arbor built, tents' erected and Camp meetings
held. The Sabbath School was organized by the Church in 1844, &quot;which
partook of the spirit of the Church, and has been striving for the advancement
of the cause of Christ ever since..&quot; This statement was from the Church
'History written in 1902 by Bess Blasingim Coffman (Mrs. J.D.), and Cora Gregory
Blasingim (Mrs. J.H.) and furnished the information prior to 1902.</p>

<p align="center">After the Church became self-supporting the pastoral
relationship was established, and has had regular preaching services except
during the Civil War. The following ministers had served prior to 1902: C.B.
Porter, William Gracey, Robert Young, James Calhoun, Carson P. Reed, James
Kirkland, Felix Johnson, James Galloway, William Walker. J.F. Gracy, T.B. Wood,
I. McIntosh, Holmes Baldridge, Addison Mitchell Kerr, J.F. Walker , and J.M. Ashford.
There were 150 members in 1902, and three ministers had gone out from this
Church. The Rev. Bush Reagin was one of the ministers, who married Frances
Madora &quot;Dora&quot; Kerr, a daughter of Addison M. Kerr, Circuit Rider. The history of the Church furnishes a
list of other elders chosen and ordained before 1902: John A. Paisley, Joseph B.
Gracey, John Smith, James White, James D. Paisley, Addison M. Kerr, D.B. Dolins,
Thomas Hanna, Stephen Ashford, Samuel Cosby, W.J. Blasingim, John M. Smith, Sank
Watts, and Alonzo Gilbert. At the present time there are eight ruling elders
serving this Church: Sterling Brownlow, a descendant of the first elders James
Paisley, Leslie Kerr, a son of Carson Reed Kerr &amp; grandson of Addison Kerr, minister; Thomas Bass
descendant of Benjamine Bass, Buford Eubanks, John R. Eubank, Kelsy Blasingim,
Robert McGill and Paul Dexter. To the families of the elders should be added
some of the other families that have been active in the Church. Dr. Mark Smith
Waters, who gave the benches, and his descendants, John (Borgus) Smith, who led
the singing, and his wife, Anna, organist, the Gooch family, Josh Phelps, Grover
Kimbrough, J.D. and Marvin Gregory Reagin families, Riley R. Smith. In the early
1900's revival services, which usually lasted two weeks with three services and
dinner served on the ground, were held, many members demonstrated their
religious fervor with shouting and testimonials.&nbsp;<br>

This photo was made in earlier times when the doors of the
building were still separate for women &amp; men to sit on separate sides of the
church. From the style of dress it could be dated between 1940 - 1960. Notice
the gravestone in the front right of the church. It is the gravestone of Carrie
Ruth Edmunston who died in 1879 as&nbsp; a young lady at the age of 18 years.</p>
<p>In 1953 the Church celebrated its more than 100 years
of service, the sermon was preached on this occasion by Rev. Jim Elder, pastor
of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceburg. The Church had been
redecorated, furniture refinished, modern heating and lighting installed for this
event most of the work had been done by the faithful few members There are 64
members enrolled at present (1950s), with approximately 50 enrolled in the Sunday
School. Two Sunday School rooms are being made in the back of the building for
the younger children of the Sunday School. This change necessitates having one
outside door instead of the two original doors, which were needed because in the
beginning the men sat on one side of the Church and the women on the other.
Since the Community Cemetery is in the Church yard, the Church has been used by
the Community for funerals. The Home Demonstration Club has had for many years
as a project the care of the cemetery. The first Sunday in August has beer
designated as the Home Coming Day. The members of other Churches join this group
for dinner on the ground, after the morning worship services in their respective
church. At the time an offering is made for the care of the cemetery. The Home
Coming in 1971 was a special occasion because the Kerr and Reagin Families had a
reunion on this day, and the sermon was preached by Ewel K. Reagin, Son of Rev.,
and Mrs Bush Reagin. He was the former president of Bethel College Director of
Religious Education University of Tennessee, and now writes the literature for
the Adult Sunday School quarterly. Many Families take this occasion for family
reunion, one being the Riley R. Smith and Bertha S Smith family. A memorial gift
that should be mentioned is the cover for the Communion table the cross and
candle sticks, by the William Thomas Kerr b. 1864 family, in memory of their mother, Emma Reagin
Kerr. The many generous gifts of friends of the Church, the sacrificial gifts
and labor of love by the Faithful few members under the leadership of the
minister, Rev. John Pope, has made possible the continuous work of this Church. &nbsp;<br>
