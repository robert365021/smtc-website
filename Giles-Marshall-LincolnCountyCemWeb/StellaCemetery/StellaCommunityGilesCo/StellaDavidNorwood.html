I have information on the families that were members of the Stella Church of 
Christ. My father preached there many Sundays during 1949-1953 and held a number 
of gospel meetings there, also. I will make a couple of phone calls to see if I 
can get more info and will pass along to you.<br>
<br>
Of the number of stores that were in operation in Stella during the early 50's 
there are two that I recall. Heading south and entering town on the left just 
past the Stella School was a store ran by Joseph Luster Jackson &amp; Annie Doris 
Appleton Jackson. Both are buried at Stella (Pleasant Hill) Cemetery. Also 
Billie Gene &quot;Bill&quot; Norwood, my uncle from Minor Hill operated a &quot;Peddlin Truck&quot;, 
also referred to as a &quot;Rolling Store&quot;. He work all the roads in and around 
Stella every Tuesday.<br>
<br>
I spent many Summers in the home of Thurman and Etha Crabb Jones and loved every 
minute that I was there.<i><br>
Thanks again to your crew in a wonderful history record of Stella, Tennessee.<br>
