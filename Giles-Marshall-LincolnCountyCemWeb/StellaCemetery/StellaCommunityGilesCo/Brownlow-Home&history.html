<font size="2">A photo of the home of J. S. Brownlow family &amp; home located
on what is today T. Dawes Road. Those pictured are on the balcony are Bryan
Bass, son of Thomas Edward Bass and Mary Frances Smith. Mary Frances is deceased
and T. E. Bassï¿½s second wife is Lizzie Brownlow. In front of the porch is
William Paisley Brownlow, son, and Leonard Mai Brownlow, son of Leonard Brown
Brownlow and Mollie May Mitchell. On the porch is James Marion Forsythe holding
Julia Elizabeth Forsythe, Emily Edna Brownlow Forsythe, John Miller Brownlow,
Roy Paisley Brownlow, Rena Mae Petty Brownlow holding Alene Brownlow, Thomas
Edward Bass, James Batey Bass, Elizabeth Lenorah (Lizzie) Brownlow Bass, J. S.
Brownlow, E. M. A. Paisley Brownlow, James Erskine Brownlow holding Mary Emma
Brownlow, Harriet Rose (Hattie) Reagin Brownlow, Irma Ruth Brownlow and Gertrude
Petty sister of Rena Mae Petty Brownlow. The photo was made in 1913 or 1914 as
Mary Emma Brownlow, my (Marilyn Kerr Hare) mother, was a baby. Leonard Mai Brownlow
is the grandson of J. S. and E. M. A. Brownlow and was mostly raised by them.<br>

&nbsp;This is another photo of the Brownlow family of Stella.&nbsp; From left to
right is William Paisley Brownlow, Leonard Mai Brownlow, Julia Elizabeth
Forsythe, Emily Edna Brownlow Forsythe, J, S. Brownlow and E. M. A. Paisley
Brownlow. I would guess this photo was made about the same time (1913 or 1914)
as the one above.</font></p>
