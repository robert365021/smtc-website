<p><font color="#000080" size="2">There is also an obit there as well as a
tombstone photo. I'm skeptical of some of the family posted there.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Siblings were Enoch Hancock b ca 1809 d c
1860; Nathaniel Hancock d ca 1858 Giles Co; Noah Hancock b 17 Aug 1811 in NC d
15 Apr 1855 Giles Co buried in Short Cemetery Giles Co. He m Martha R. Short

Dorcus Easter and Roxey Hancock d bef Sep 1849 m Benjamin Smith. Ref: Giles Co
Will Abstracts 1814-1900 pgs 46 &amp; 47</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Hull Huggins Hancock married 3 times. First
wife was Frances A Hightower or maybe her name was Mary Frances Hightower whom
he married 14 Dec 1837. She died 13 Dec 1840 during childbirth according to
Harris Hanock family tree guide. Their children Elizabeth A &quot;Aunt Puss&quot;
Hancock b 27 Sep 1838 m Dr Thomas D Davenport b 17 Feb 1820 bur Mt Moriah and
Cooper H Hancock b 1840 d 14 Dec 1840. Harris Hancock also lists Mary Hancock who
married Billy Beasley-I think she was the daughter of the second wife.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Second wife was Ursula Caroline Beasley whom
he married in 1841. She was b 25 Mar 1824 d 1 Jan 1855 according to the listing
in Giles Co Cemetery book, buried in the Beasley/Fogg cemetery.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Their children were Enoch (Uncle Doc) b 19 Dec
1842 d 2 Jan 1896 in Memphis TN, then Mary Hancock b ca 1844 m William Beasley;
Noah Mann Hancock b 3 May 1849 in TN; Martha Ann Elizabeth (Mattie) Hancock b 9
Sep 1852 d 21 May 1880 who m D W Burch or W T Burch 16 Jan 1872; Maborn/Maibon/Mabon
b 24 Nov 1853 d 24 Nov 1923 buried Memphis TN</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Ursula Caroline Beasley was previously married
to Samuel C Reed and had a son William Reed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Third wife was Nancy Minerva Kerr daughter of
Samuel Kerr and Anna Paisley b 4 May 1825 Giles Co TN d 11 Nov 1914 Tulsa Ok
buried Oak Lawn Cemetery Tulsa OK. Circumstances of her death are on the
HarrisHancock site.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Their children were William Addison Hancock b
15 Jan 1857 Giles Co TN died 15 Jun 1912 Tulsa OK bur Oak Lawn Cemetery Tulsa
OK. Apparently he never married. Her other child was James Samuel Hancock b 13
Nov 1861 Giles Co d 19 Apr 1910 during the time the 1910 Fed Census was being
taken. James Samuel Hancock m 26 Oct 1886 Giles Co TN Gentry Horne dau of James
Horne and Susan F Barnes. Gentry was born 5 Mar 1867 d 25 May 1955 buried Oak
Lawn Cemetery Tulsa OK.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">Children of James Samuel Hancock and Gentry
Horne were 1) Hull Henry Hancock b 12 Oct 1887 d 18 Apr 1849 bur Oak Lawn Cem
Tulsa OK (from HarrisHancock), 2) Anna Lou Hancock b 27 Oct 1889 d 23 Nov 1968
and 3) Willie B(eatrice) Hancock b 21 Sep 1894. Several of her letters are on
HarrisHancock, but I'm trying to figure out just whom she is talking about.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">It was Addison Mitchell Kerr who died at the
Hancock House. You'll find the details on the Giles Co page under Letters
entitled Samuel Kerr to his son 1872. Although I have not heard it, it is
possible that Samuel Kerr died there as well as he was living with them in the
1880 census.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">As yet I do not know William (Billy)
Beasley&nbsp; whom Mary Hancock married.<br>
