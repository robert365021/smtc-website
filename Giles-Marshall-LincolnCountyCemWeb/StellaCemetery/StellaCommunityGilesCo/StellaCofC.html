We a looking at what was at one time the Church of Christ 
but later was used by others. The facility is no longer in use.. If you know of 
any history on this church please let this site administrator know and we can 
post it here.&nbsp;It is located on the west side of the road in Stella just before 
one gets to the crossroads. David Norwood's father preached her some in the 
1940s/1950s.<br>
<br>
Stella Church of Christ (history of) - 
Stella, Giles County, Tennessee<br>
<br>
In the late 1920�s a tract of land in Stella was deeded for the establishment of 
a Church of Christ meeting place by Bob and Bertha Hazelwood (How are they 
related to Bob and Birdie shown below)? The congregation first met in an old 
store building where planks were placed on barrels for seating. The barrels were 
probably nail kegs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John David and Lorena M. &quot;Rena&quot; Beard Tucker donated the lumber to build the 
meeting house. The building. including the smooth slat pews, was built by the 
members of the congregation. The first services were held about 1930. Baptisms 
were held in Shoal Creek that flowed behind the building. A long table was 
constructed between the building and the creek to place food on for special 
events such as all day singing and dinner on the grounds.</p>

Homecoming was always celebrated on the second Sunday in June. After the worship 
service, a feast was enjoyed, followed by an afternoon of a cappella singing. 
Just as soon as Amen was said at the end of the worship service, the ladies 
headed out the door to load the long table with their own special recipes. Soon 
the rest of the congregation followed after which the blessing was offered. The 
women then stood guard with dish towels waving off those pesky flies and 
steering us toward their special treats.<br>
<br>
Very few items were store bought. Most of the food was made from scratch. There 
must have been at least 8 to 10 bowls of potato salad, all the fried chicken you 
could want, well seasoned beans and peas of every variety, and baked sweet 
potatoes covered with marshmallows. Besides all the fried chicken, there was 
plenty of roast beef, ham, fried fatback, sometimes some streak-o-lean, and 
someone always brought some form of goat. An abundance of yeast rolls, cornbread 
and biscuits were the bread choices. At the end of the table there was a huge 
selection of desserts waiting to be explored. The homemade pies and cakes looked 
like entries for the Tennessee State Fair. Each one looked like a Blue Ribbon 
Winner to me. Two things I always looked for was the banana pudding and fried 
pies. I always grabbed a fried pie or two and hid it in the car for a snack 
after the singing. The choices were a little of this and some of that and a 
smidgen or two of the rest. <br>
<br>
Other homemade items placed randomly over the table were bread and butter 
pickles, sweet pickle relish, chow chow, dill pickles, and some hot peppers. The 
exceptions to the made from scratch rule would have been soft drinks for the 
kids, a few loaves of bread for sandwiches, stuffed olives and sweet gherkins, 
and of course the condiments. <br>
<br>
For refreshments the # 2 washtub was full of soft drinks and iced down enough 
for us to want more than one. There must have been 15 gallons of sweet tea and a 
few gallons of lemonade.<br>
<br>
After everyone had had their fill of delicious food and the tables cleared, we 
headed back into the building for an afternoon of a cappella singing. The hills 
and hollows around Stella must have been spiritually lifted because the rafters 
of the little building on Shoal Creek literally shook to the four part harmony 
for the next two hours. <br>
<br>
The wedding on June 18th, 1971 of Donna Jackson to Winfred Barnett may have been 
the last wedding in the building. <br>
<br>
Sadly, the Stella Church of Christ no longer meets. The numbers dwindled as 
families moved away or passed on to meet their Maker. The property has been 
deeded back to the Hazelwood family as was stated in the original deed. Only the 
memories remain. Whether it was feasting on food or Feasting on the Word of God, 
the love and fellowship that we experienced at the Little White Church on Shoal 
Creek in Stella, Tennessee, was second to none this side of Heaven.<br>
<br>
I�m sure each one of us would love to go back to those events that I recall from 
over 60 years ago. <br>
<br>
Special thanks to Tillman Dawes, Robert Dean Jones, and Donna Jackson Barnett 
for helping me sort all of this out.<br>
