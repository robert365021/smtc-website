<p align="center">Stella School<br>
<img border="0" src="Img_5445.jpg" width="706" height="366"></a></p>
<p align="center">This is a recent 2004 photo looking at the front of the old Stella School. In an article by Mary Lee
Harris she says the old Stella school was
replaced by a new structure and was used from 1926-1937. It then became an
elementary school from 1938 to about 1949 (my estimate) and then later became a community
center. Notice the
hand pump well still installed over the well. It is believed the James Paisley family being here as
early as 1815 might have been the initial founding family for this
community. The Paisley and Kerr families were big on starting community schools
and it is a bet there was some kind of schooling going on here in this community
of large families and many children to educate in the early to mid 1800s. The
Kerr family and others joined in then and later to make it a thriving
and lively village.&nbsp; The original structure was a log structure standing about here
where the current school is
now located. It being a log
structure which was taken over by the school and integrated or abolished for the
purpose of improving the school facility. The above facility is now a thriving
community center.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
