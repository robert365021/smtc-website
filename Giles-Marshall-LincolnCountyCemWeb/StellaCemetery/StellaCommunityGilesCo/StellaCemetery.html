Looking southwest at the Stella
Cemetery and School House. Many of Stella and the surrounding community's early
inhabitant lie here beneath these grounds. It is believed the James Paisley family being here as
early as 1815 might have been the initial founding family for the Presbyterian
church here. We
know it was meeting at least by the 1820s but not in this building
when the Samuel
Kerr moved here from Spring Hill in Maury County and married Anna Paisley and
started a family. The original schoolhouse structure was down the hill where the current school is
now located and was standing in the early part of the 1900s. It being a log
structure which was taken over by the school and integrated or abolished for the
purpose of improving the school facility. You will find many of the early
inhabitants interred here. The building in
your view was built in 1926 and served at one time as a high school which I
understand was partially torn away in recent years. <br/>
