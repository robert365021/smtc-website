<p align="center">HANNA COMMUNITY&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Reaching back one hundred years
or more we find there was settlement where Adrian Merritt now lives. Jerry
Barnes, one of the first settlers lived and owned a large farm. He raised a
large family and his youngest daughter, Miss Gentry, fell heir to the home plot
of land. She first married Andrew White and after his death married Dave Shores.
These first settlers started a graveyard, which was later enlarged, fenced and
is known as the &quot;Shores Cemetery&quot; (at Hanna Baptist Church).</p>
<p align="center">The next settlement was, where
the Will Gooch house now stands, and was owned by James Hanna, father of Thomas
Hanna. Back in those days three man - - named Hanna, Reed and Donaldson, owned
five thousand acres of land known as the Donaldson survey, the boundary line
beginning near where Roy Barksdale now lives, then east to a point west of Aspen
Hill, thence south to a point near Kedron, thence west to the beginning. All
this area was at first this community, but since then it has been divided into
parts of other communities.</p>
<p align="center">The next residence stood where
Mrs. C. McCormick now lives and was owned by a man by the name of Jones, who
later lived where J. L. Kimbrough now lives. This man was the father of James A.
Jones. John Lewis Jones lived where Edd Howard now lives, and Laucy Jones lived
at the place known as the McCormice place, now owned by Herbert Smith. Reaching
down as far as the Stella Community, the next residence was where Renzo Smith
now lives and was then owned by Uncle Sammie Kerr, father of Addison Kerr, who
was a teacher and Presbyterian preacher. Incidentally, Uncle Sammie was a
mechanic and he made spinning wheels, reels, etc. for household use, some of
which are still in use today.</p>
<p align="center">Perhaps the first school
building on shoal creek stood not far from where Will Brownlow's residence now
stands, and was known as the academy. This school probably was run by private
subscriptions, as it existed prior to the time the Tennessee legislature passed
a general school law.</p>
<p align="center">As far back as we have been
informed, there has been a Baptist Church on Dog Branch and also a Baptist
Church where the Church of Christ (New Zion) now stands. Mt Carmel (Methodist)
and the Pleasant Hill, now known as Stella (Cumberland Presbyterian) Churches
were the first to serve the immediate community.</p>
<p align="center">About the year 1875, Thomas
Hanna put up a gristmill. This mill stood near the south end of the Shores
cemetery, and almost exactly where the highway is now located. This mill served
the people almost from Minor Hill to Aspen Hill and from Cedar Grove to the
Alabama line.</p>
<p align="center">The blacksmith's shop that can
be remembered was just east of the bridge at Erskin Brownlow's farm and was
owned and operated by T. C. Reagin, as to the stores back in those days most of
he barter trade went to Lester's Station and was sold to N. S. Beasley and a man
by the name of Bayless. A few years back though there have been stores operated
by different people in this community.</p>
<p align="center">The Hanna Community now has
about thirty or thirty-five families. In this community there is one shop and
one gristmill. Most of the people go to other communities not far away to
stores, mills, and shops. The school is now the center of the community, since
they do not have church here. All the people go to nearby churches to worship.</p>
<p align="center">Thomas Hannah deeded the plot
of land on which the Hanna School was built to Giles County about the year 1878
for the consideration of $12.50 H. Taylor Smith was at one time the teacher of
the Hanna School [now 2004 he has a road named after him near Stella]<br>
