	This cemetery has been abandoned and destroyed to the point it is no longer 
	possible to do a normal survey. The cemetery has towering over it a rotten 
	tree trunk that has turned the cemetery into a waste land of rotten tree 
	logs. Just bits and pieces of stones are scattered around and nothing can be 
	found with inscription except the above two stones as shown. I must concede 
	there may still be other stones below the high weeds of the tree log that I 
	may have missed.  One stone (Mattie Parks) was protected by an iron 
	fence and survived. The other stone (Jesse W. Parks) was dug from the 
	ground. It is possible and likely some of the listings above were originally 
	unmarked graves. How do we know?</font></b></p>
