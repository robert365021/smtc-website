	8 or 10 Graves with Rock 
	Vaults (so called when a bunch of field rocks are stacked over a grave as a 
	grave cover) have about all tumbled to the ground and disappeared. I think 
	the most likely location is the center of photo number 7792 under the trees 
	next to the pond. The GPS is centered in that area somewhere, if the GPS is 
	correct.</b></p>
