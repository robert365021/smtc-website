Pension application for William Smith is dated 16 October 1832. Now a resident 
of Lincoln County, Tennessee and is age 70 years; states he was born 17th of 
February 1762 in Lunenburg County, Virginia. He was living in Washington County, 
North Carolina in that part which later became Tennessee in a settlement on the 
Watauga River which was labeled later the Watauga settlement when he first 
volunteered as a lad of fourteen years of age in the year 1776 and at that time 
was living with his widowed mother. He describes several tours of duty and his 
experiences. His first officer was Captain (later Colonel) John Sevier he was 
promoted to &quot;ensign&quot; in March 1781 under Captain Valentine Sevier and was later 
&quot;Lieutenant&quot; and on an expedition in September 1782 was appointed &quot;Captain&quot; by 
Colonel John Sevier. <br>
Smith relates how they rescued a white woman named Jane Ireland who had been taken 
captive on Roan's Creek, Washington County, North Carolina, and also a white man 
named Samuel Martin who had been captured by the Indians at Nashville. His 
residence at the time of the war was 300 to 400 miles from Carter County, Tennessee which was 
the part of Washington County, North Carolina in which he lived during the 
periods of his enlistments from Washington County, North Carolina. He removed to 
what is now Davidson County, Tennessee in 1789 and lived there and then just 
southeast of there in Rutherford 
County, Tennessee until the year 1807 and from there he removed to Lincoln County, 
Tennessee. No family data is known except mention is made of a son-in-law (and 
daughter) who received mail in Fayetteville, Tennessee in 1833 and whose name is 
Isaac Southworth. Of the several William Smith's this biography best matches his 
family and listing above. </font></p>
