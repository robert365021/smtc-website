Transcribed from Family research by C Wayne Austin &amp; others over about 20 years.
Added here 22 May 2016 by C. Wayne Austin. This cemetery
is not presented in any historical records. Nor can we offer proof of location 
to the extent that land use could be restricted based on cemetery location, 
without further site investigation. This treatise is strictly based on knowledge 
of how folks in the old days buried their kin on their own land. I debated 
whether to add them here or in the Unity Cemetery in unmarked graves some 3+ 
miles to the northeast of here. It is my sincere hope that should the one in a 
million chance come true and these graves are found and it is not in the above 
location that someone will correct this and any other records spun from this.</b></i></p>
