EPPS FAMILY GRAVES, Hughey Rd, LINCOLN COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
 </font></b></p>
<p>Discussion with Mr. Barnes, born abt 1945 on 7 May 2015 who lived across the 
road from the Epps Hollow but down the road east of there a few hundred yards on 
Hughey Rd. He said "My estimation of when his grandfather purchased the property 
would be about 1920-1930. He said they tore down an old home and moved it across 
the road years ago. It was located on the Epps Hollow side."<br/>
<br/>
Arney was the family name of his grandfather who purchased the Epps property at 
the house he was discussing.<br/>
 </p>
<p>Mr Barnes mentioned the family that now owns the biggest part of Epps Hollow 
and that family lives far back up the hollow northeast of where we were 
standing. That is when he mentioned they removed an old home from there and it 
was rebuilt across the road somewhere.</p>
<p>We were not standing on the Epps Hollow place for this conversation, but on 
the property adjacent to that on the west (based on Google lot lines), but it is 
a part of the hollow which either becomes Epps Hollow or was at one time a part 
of Epps Hollow.<br/>
A black Family named Briggs (kin to the ones in Sulfur Springs Cemetery?) who 
was employed by Alabama A &amp; M in Huntsville Alabama bought the place just west 
of the Epps or what may have been Epps Hollow years ago and the current owner 
bought the place from Briggs after that family moved away. The purchasing family 
currently lives in the home on the hill but she works away from the home and so 
does he and are not available for interview today.<br/>
Mr. Barnes lives in the second house on the right going east in front of what is 
marked as the Ramsey Cemetery on the hill top behind the house.<br/>

<p>Mr. Barnes said he showed the fellow directly across the street from where we 
were standing where the (did not mention the cemetery name) McLean Cem was 
located in back of his house, but that there were no marked stones there now, 
but one can tell it is an old cemetery.<br/>

 </p>
<p>This map shows two checks where Mr. Barnes says there may be an old cemetery 
there somewhere but he was not conclusive, but maybe it is further up the hill. 
This is a map showing the complete hollow (Epps)<br/>

<p>We were standing and talking at the above GPS while they worked on tractors.<br/>

 </p>
<p>Mr. Barnes lives here or maybe the home whereby one can only see the next 
driveway on the left up the road.<br/>

A home is seen here according to the Topo maps so that this may be the old Epps 
Home site.<br/>
The home that was moved stood at this GPS North 35.20919 West  -86.67071. 
It was still showing on the 1940 Topography maps but is gone today </p>
