EPPS FAMILY GRAVES, Hughey Rd, LINCOLN COUNTY TENNESSEE</b><b><img border="0" src="EppsCe2.jpg"><br>
I made an assumption that they took the bodies down the residential lane and 
buried them on the north side of the road in graves were there were flat and 
unclear of rock out cropping where they could find soil.&nbsp; This tradition 
usually started with small children that died young even at birth&nbsp; and 
established a family graveyard that way. This is also based on the topographical 
maps of the 1940s showing the farm/residential road back to this place. It 
terminated at the home place where I have the label for the home in yellow.<br>

This map shows two checks where Mr. Barnes says there may be an old unmarked cemetery somewhere. 
He was not conclusive. Maybe it is further up the hill. 
This is a map showing the complete hollow (Epps) After evaluation of the 
topographical features of the two locations I have concluded the check on the 
right is just rough terrain and that is why it is not cleared land.Not sure the 
left check is still on Epps land.<br>
