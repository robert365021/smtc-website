  From the above map we see the Beech Hill Cemetery GPS location. It is across 
the road from the extinct Beech Hill High School, 1917 - 1978. A monument is 
in place to remind us of that. <br>

northeast out of Pulaski for about 8 miles and
  turn right at Hopkins Rd which almost immediately merges into Blackburn Road 
at Brick Church. Turn south on Blackburn Road. At the Blackburn Road and Clock 
Creek Road merge right and go about 3 more miles. When the Blackburn Road 
terminates at Beech Hill Road (aka Old Hwy 15) turn left and after another 2/3 of a mile the 
Beech Hill Church of Christ will be on your right. The entrance up the hill to 
the cemetery will be on your left.</b></font><img border="0" src="BeechHillCemAerial.jpg" width="929" height="397"><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><br>
  This Aerial Map shows the plot where the cemetery resides next to Interstate 
65. Beech Hill/Bradshaw/Centerpoint Road goes under Interstate Highway 65 
nearby. The cemetery access road is across the road in front of the Beech Hill 
Church of Christ. Be prepared for your vehicle to climb a steep road up to the 
cemetery. The Church of Christ and old school site is in the valley of the 
Little Bradshaw Creek.<br>
