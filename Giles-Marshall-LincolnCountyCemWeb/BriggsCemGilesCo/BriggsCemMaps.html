</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Location: Go 
west on Highway 31 North from Pulaski several miles and turn right (east) on 
Buford Station Rd. Then take the first left on Abernathy Rd and go about a mile 
&amp; 1/2 or until the road curves sharply right. Next go another 2 tenths of a mile 
and turn left into the first driveway which is Mr. Dunnivant's and his son's 
places. They have a lot of old farm machinery &amp; other private things so leave 
all that alone. The cemetery is in one of the Privy Hedge thickets due north of 
the 1st barn you come to about 100 yards but you cannot get there from that 
instruction. The routing into the cemetery is to go past the barn (on the south 
side) and turn (right) north and go to the gate and then turn back due east on 
the field road toward the cemetery. It is down the field road 200 feet. You will 
first go under the trees and come out in a small field while all going due east 
toward the edge of thicket where the cemetery located ahead of you.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
A series of gates are in your way so only visit this cemetery with the 
oversight &amp; instructions of the Dunnivants'.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery on the left of the 
road just after the 
bend in the road to the right. The other two cemeteries marked on this map are 
the C=Compton-Daught Cemetery and B=Hart Cemetery (three stones located in a 
flower bed on the left side of the road under a tree).<br>
