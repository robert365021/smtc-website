</font>This lost cemetery at this GPS upon the hill on East side of Parks Road 
(This is near the Renegar Cem.)&nbsp; I (C.W. Austin) have not been here but by 
the exploration of historical cemetery mapping (USGS Mapping) and Google maps I 
am lead to believe this cemetery can be found at
<a href="MorganCemGPS.jpg">GPS N 35.20144 X W -86.47252</a>
<span style="background-color: #008000">(yellow Check)</span>
though I know there are no signs of marked stones 
in the middle of a cleared cattle pasture.&nbsp; Other possibilities are:

<span style="background-color: #008000">(Pink

these places could be an old house site, or a slave graveyard with few signs of 
the graves today or even a unreported cemetery for early settlers with or 
without marked stones. <br>

<p align="left">No one has found this cemetery in many 
years if ever. Court papers say:</p>
<p align="left">MORGAN, Capt John, 1753 - 1816, 
Revolutionary War Soldier who came to Lincoln County in the latter part of his 
life - interred near here in&nbsp; a lost grave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Capt John Morgan is believed to be buried here though his grave is lost. 
He was born 1753 and died 1816 or 1817, but as you will read below some say 
1830ish and was known to be a Revolutionary War Soldier - see below.<br>
<br>
Information according to the book Cemetery Records of Lincoln County Tennessee 
by Tim &amp; Helen Marsh. Their source was court house records.<br>
<br>
It is known that Lewis Morgan and Henry Morgan lived in this neighborhood as 
found in the 1820-1830 censuses. I do not know if Lewis &amp; Henry died here or 
transferred elsewhere. See <a href="Austin-Morgan-Settlements-LincolnCoTn.jpg">

<br>
Capt. John Morgan.<br>
<br>
Written by Jay Guy Cisco<br>
From Historic Sumner County, Tennessee 1909.<br>
<br>
Captain John Morgan, a Revolutionary soldier, came to Sumner County in 1784 with 
his father-in-law, Major William Hall, whose eldest daughter, Mary, he had 
married before leaving North Carolina. He built his fort on an eminence in the 
vicinity of Rogana, on lands now owned by Dr. Jesse Johnson. Some of the logs of 
which the fort was constructed are now in the walls of a barn on the farm of Dr. 
Johnson. Captain Morgan's father, Squire John Morgan, came with him and was 
killed by an Indian warrior while returning from the spring under the hill. The 
Indian rushed upon him and sank his tommyhawk deeply into his brain, where it 
was left, being too tightly wedged into the skull to be withdrawn. He also lost 
a brother, Armistead, a fine young man, and very popular with the settlers. He 
was killed from an ambush at Southwest Pass, on the route from Knoxville, while 
piloting a party of emigrants..<br>
<br>
Captain Morgan's eldest daughter, Nancy, married James Bright of Kentucky, who 
was a surveyor, and settled at Fayetteville, Lincoln County, about 1803 and 
where Captain Morgan also settled about the same time. On the breaking out of 
the Creek War he raised a company of mounted troops and joined General Jackson 
at the rendezvous at Huntsville, Ala. He was a large, handsome man, with noble 
features and gray hair that hung down on his shoulders and when he rode through 
Fayetteville at the head of his company his appearance and the occasion were 
never forgotten by those who witnessed it, and is one of the traditions of the 
town. He was well advanced in years, but he said: &quot;A man should never get too 
old to fight the British and Indians.&quot;.<br>
<br>
He died some time in the 1830's and was buried near Mulberry. His wife survived 
him until 1850 and is buried in the old cemetery at Fayetteville. General John 
Morgan Bright, one of the most honored citizens of Fayetteville, is a grandson 
of Captain John Morgan. Colonel E. L. Drake of Winchester is his great-grandson.
<br>
In a letter to the write he says; &quot;I remember my great-grandmother Morgan (Mary) 
very distinctly-how her black eyes flashed at the mention of the British or 
Indians.&quot;</p>
