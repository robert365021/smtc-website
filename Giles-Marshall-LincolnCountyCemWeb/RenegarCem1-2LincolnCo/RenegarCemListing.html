This cemetery in which I have not been on the premises is inside a tall well 
protected rock wall. I am unaware of who takes&nbsp; care of it, but it but it is 
maintained. I could not identify the people that owned the Key-Pad Locked Gate to 
the Farm. Findagrave's Carol Payne has visited this cemetery and photographed 
most of the above grave listings shown&nbsp; above. See at
Findagrave.com - Renegar Cemetery. Carol has donated her photos (Thanks, 
permission 22 Oct 2015) to be used here but also visit her works on findagrave 
for this cemetery. Photos beginning with PhotoA are the property of Carol Payne. 
She has made the photos between 2012 &amp; 2013. Note from Carol Petty Payne 
3:07pm Oct 25 2015: The personal pictures are courtesy of Kat (Watson) Prawl who 
lives in southwest Texas. Her great grandmother was Cordelia Tennessee Cashion 
and a cousin who lives in Dallas inherited a photo album and Cordelia's Family 
Bible and as she was not interested in her ancestry gave the album and Bible to 
Kat. Carol has yet to uncover any tombstones for the Parks Couple above but 
likely there are stones which have fallen and sunken below ground somewhere on 
the premises or the graves were never marked.<br>
