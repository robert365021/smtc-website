		64 to Hwy 50 and turn north. Travel then to Parks Road several miles 
		away and turn south on that. Follow Parks Road for a mile and the 
		cemetery is on a high security &amp; very private Griffin-Mulberry farm. You 
		will be unable to gain access to this cemetery even though you can see 
		it from the gate. The gate has coded access and perhaps other security 
		instrumentation. <br>
