 Yeah, I'm aware of the gate and keypad.  I've made friends with the woman who owns the farm's farm manager and when I want to go I call him
and he opens the gate for me.  I only go during the week as last time I went was on a Saturday and he wasn't too happy about having to go open
the gate for me.  Take what you want from FAG or I can send you some of the pictures I've taken if you will let me know exactly what you want.
I've been down there numerous times and taken lots of pictures.  I'm wanting to go down this fall, so if you want, I can meet you and we can go
together.  Let me know.
