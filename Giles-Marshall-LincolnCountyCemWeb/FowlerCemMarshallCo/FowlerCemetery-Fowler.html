There has been confusion in the ancestry of several Fowler families and 
hopefully this will help clarify.<br>
<br>
The wife of the John L. Fowler who is buried in Fowler Cemetery, Cornersville, 
TN, was Lucinda Perkins. They were married before 1836 and had a number of 
children. Two daughters, Elizabeth Duncan (25-Jul-1836 - 25-Mar-1926) and Jane 
Emerson (2-Oct-1840 ï¿½ 14-Jan-1929) lived long enough that Tennessee death 
certificates with parent names were recorded. Jane Emerson's death certificate 
plainly states that her mother was &quot;Lucinda Perkins&quot; and her father &quot;John L. 
Fowler&quot;. Jane Emerson is buried in Fowler Cemetery near her parents. The 
information as posted of the marriage of this John L. Fowler and Lucinda Perkins 
on findagrave.com is therefore proven correct. Elizabeth Duncan's death 
certificate gives her father's name as &quot;John L. Fowler&quot; and her mother as simply 
&quot;Perkins&quot; confirming Jane's information. Elizabeth is buried in Lewisburg, TN.
<br>
<br>
What has caused confusion is that a Lewis Fowler (many say John Lewis Fowler) 
married a Lucinda Perkins in Pike County, AL, 29-Jun-1836. However, they lived 
in Louisiana. He went by the name Lewis Fowler and is recorded that way in his 
marriage license and in the census.<br>
<br>
The John L. Fowler who is buried in Fowler Cemetery near Cornersville, TN, lived 
in Marshall County, TN. At the same time the Lewis Fowler couple lived in 
Louisiana. The censuses for Tennessee and Louisiana from 1850 on verify they are 
not the same people. Jane (Fowler) Emerson, daughter of John L. Fowler of 
Marshall County, TN, was born less than a month after Lewis Fowler and Lucinda 
Perkins were married in Pike County, AL. Dozens if not hundreds of people have 
assigned the vital statistics dates of the Marshall County, TN Fowlers to the 
Louisiana Fowlers. They obviously are not the same people. <br>
<br>
The John L. Fowler who married Lucinda &quot;Mabary&quot; in 1846 in Marshall County, TN 
is a totally different person from the above two John L. Fowlers and can be 
found living in Coffee County, TN, in 1870 and 1880. Some of their descendants 
have also erroneously assigned the vital statistics of the Marshall County, TN 
Fowlers to the Coffee County, TN Fowlers.<br>
