This aerial map shows the cemetery marked with a red check., It looks here like 
it is under the trees but the cemetery is largely cleared. You are following a 
right of way off of Collier Rd to get here. It is well maintained &amp; fenced. The 
road to the cemetery also doubles as the road to residential property and also to farm operations so be 
sure you go here with deliberate upscale intentions and secure permission if 
needed.<br>
