Subject: [TN-CHESTNUTRIDGECOUSINS] William &amp; Easter Wright Crenshaw<br>
<br>
In the new �Cemetery Records of Lincoln County, Tennessee And Adjoining 
Counties� has both William &amp; Easter buried in the Harkins cemetery. From a <br>
family work sheet found in Ruth Morgan files at the Fayetteville public library 
made out by Billie Forrester did have Easter buried there in an unmarked grave.
<br>
I have a copy but it is packed away someplace. I do not recall seeing anything 
about William being buried there. Does anyone know where the Genealogical <br>
Society got the information to put in the book? Did it come from those Ruth 
Morgan�s files?<br>

Julia,<br>
Margaret (Springer) Crenshaw died in 1881 and is buried in Waggoner-Buckeye 
Cemetery 
in Moore County. There are two fieldstones next to her grave on the downhill 
side. I have
always thought that one of them is probably her husband, Paschel Crenshaw, died
1857.<br>
The other one I thought might be their son, William T. Crenshaw who died in 
1852. But,
if he is in Harkins, then the other fieldstone might be their grandson, William
Thomas, who
died in 1868, not long after he came home from the Civil War. </font></b></p>
