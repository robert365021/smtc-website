No Margaret DNA test has to be on Warren men, Women cant do the DNA on Type Y. 
The paragraph above and other is not correct as Nancy Warren's maiden name is 
unknown, no last name was ever found for her, absolutely nothing pointing to the 
elder Daniel Warren (b 1775) who did marry Mary Hendrick, not a widow but a 
daughter of Wm Hendrick being father or stepfather to our Daniel, (this Daniel 
winds up in Tx around 1840ish along with all his chldren named in his will) more 
documented proof came out after this above printed info, Much of which I was 
able to prove. I can say the Warrens did come out of NC, along with several 
other familes, Hendricks, Ethridges, which they also married into, to Lincoln 
Co.&nbsp; Chestnut Ridge Cousins - Cindy Kinard 2:57pm 2015 Jul 2 <br>

I [Jane Warren Waller] stopped at the home of Mrs. Bartlett, a great 
granddaughter of Daniel, and some distant cousin of mine--not recognized <br>
by either of us. She said that she had had three names in her life and all three 
were Bartlett. Her maiden name and both husbands were Bartlett. Her first Warren 
story, as I later found to be the usual, was of Daniel's gold. She pointed 
across the road to a hill in the distance, beyond Warren cemetery, and said, 
&quot;Around 1940 men were blasting the rocks on the hillside and people came from 
all around to see if 'Ole Dan'l's' gold would be uncovered. The many tales I 
heard through the day tell the same story. It would seem that great, great 
granddad Warren had little faith in banks. So, he kept his gold in a trunk in a 
closet under the stairs. This trunk has been described as one covered with fur 
or hide, much like a spotted <br>
pony hide. I liked best Mr. Berry Wagster's description, as the &quot;wooly trunk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aunt Mollie (a daughter of Daniel Warren) lived until 1956, so many are the 
stories passed down from her. She remembered her father's pleasure <br>
in his old age, as he sat drowsing by the fire as she combed his hair. He always 
wanted a burning fire in all seasons with the explanation, &quot;I can breathe better 
if there is a fire.&quot; The only physical description of Daniel was given by Aunt 
Mollie, &quot;He was a powerful man, tall and handsome with gray eyes.&quot; The family 
had a yearly reminder of Daniel's death, as each January 8th, Aunt Mollie 
refused to eat.<br>

<br>
23 Mar 1965. Ora S. Warren letter to Jane W.
Waller:
&quot;Pappy's dream girl was 'Mindy Wheeler-- 
prettiest thing on earth' -- in his youth. He <br>
was old as it went those days when he saw the 
black curly headed, vivacious Julie Ann Drennan
standing on the steps of Old New Hope A.R.P. <br>
Church between Molino &amp; Harms. He told me how 
very pretty she was and he resolved to marry 
her. He was �well off� as it went in those days <br>
� a farm, team &amp; well on way up. She was an 
orphan. Her mother thought it a wonderful match 
&amp; her step father Lee Gale was not too kind.&quot;<br>
<br>
JULIE ANN DRENNAN Julie Ann Warren was born on
9 Feb 1855 in 20th District, Lincoln County, TN.

remembers she almost &quot;killed&quot; her great-grandmother when they were climbing a ladder to 
a hayloft to collect chicken eggs. A chicken 
flew up in Jane's face and she reared back, 
almost knocking Julia off the ladder. Related to 
her son George Waller in 1995 in Lincoln County, <br>
TN. She *Nancy Warren Grammer, granddaughter
of Julie, remembered that an oft quoted phrase 
of Julie's was: 'This old world is rocking.' <br>
That had to be before 1930, little did Julie 
know that by 1991 'This old world is rocking and 
rolling.' She died on 6 Dec 1930 in Yukon, 
Lincoln County, TN, at age 75 1997: her death

was a real tale tellers�Trusitala�s I believe <br>
Rob�t Louis Stevenson called it. I�ve always
had an urge to write up old Elk River Drennan
home with slim, beautiful, black haired (curls), <br>
sparkling brown eyed Julia. She was quite pert 
from all she told and as I remembered her�quite 
haughty at times with a particular lift of the <br>
head with a slight toss when displeased�.She 
remembers Yank soldiers storming their house 
(her mother a widow with 3 small children) &amp; <br>
demanding food be cooked for all. Food so 
scarce too. She was so pert she asked one Yank 
to give her a pretty little pen knife he had. <br>
He answered her roughly �I have a little girl at 
home who would like very well to have it.� �. 
Mammy Warren remembered how they had to bury <br>
their meat &amp; other food until Yanks left. They 
even took dirt under smoke houses &amp; boiled out 
the salt. Couldn�t get salt, medicine nor <br>
anything�. I�m sure Reb. Soldiers acted just as
bad. People are always the same � good and 
bad.&quot;<br>
