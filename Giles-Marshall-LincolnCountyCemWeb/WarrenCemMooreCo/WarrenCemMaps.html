  From the above map we see the Warren Cemetery GPS location. It is on the 
Bartlett Hollow Road just inside the drainage basin for the West 
Fork of Mulberry Creek.&nbsp; <br>

  <font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial Black"><b>Location: From Shelbyville go south on Hwy 
		231 several miles and turn left on Bartlett Hollow Road and go about 
about 3/4 of a mile and the road into the cemetery is on the right in front of a 
house and the caretaker of the cemetery. The cemetery is on that almost field 
road about 100 yards on the left. I felt for an elderly lady that met me there . 
She apologized for the condition of the cemetery, and said her husband had 
passed away, and she did not have the health anymore to maintain it. If you can 
get by there and do some grounds maintenance please do. The fence is falling 
down and the grass is waist high now. Better yet, maybe you can donate to a fund 
to the upkeep of this cemetery. </b></font><font face="Arial Black"><font size="2" color="#000080">

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery marked with a red check in a clearing among 
the trees. On this map the road to this cemetery is covered in trees, but 
generally follows the pattern of the trees coming southwest from the road to the 
west side of the cemetery. All this is co-mingled with farm assets so  
notification of neighbors of your intentions is a good idea before visiting.<br>
