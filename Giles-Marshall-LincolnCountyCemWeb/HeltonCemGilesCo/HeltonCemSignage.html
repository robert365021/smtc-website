  This photo shows the Cemetery sign you will see from Rose Hill Road. Follow
  that field road and go thru the gate closing it to keep the cattle secure.<br>

  This is the sign at the gate into the Helton Cemetery. The wooden sign is failing so I restored
  the image graphically. However, there is a street sign just to
  the left of this that says: &quot;HELTON CEMETERY&quot;. The memorials are
  back and to the right of this image. The photographer was pointing the camera
  at an odd angle to dodge the rays of the sun which can destroy the photo visibility.<br>
