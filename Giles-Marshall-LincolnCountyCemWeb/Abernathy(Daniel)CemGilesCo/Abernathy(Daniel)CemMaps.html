</b><b>Location: Go 
northeast on Hwy 31 Alt and go to Blooming Grove Road and turn right. Follow 
that for about a mile and the cemetery is about 500 yards on your right (as a 
crow flies) west of the Road on the 
high hill in one of the thickets. This is 100 yards southwest of a small pond. Alternate but vague 
instructions: Old Highway 15, (Beech Hill Rd) and turn left into Blooming Grove Road; 1/2 mile past 
church, down the lane on the left. On hill at old Poor Farm. Now this 
instruction comes from Old Hwy 15 (Beech Hill Rd) labeled on the above map as Pisgah Pike. 
Mr Neil Bass is the land owner here.</b><b><br>
