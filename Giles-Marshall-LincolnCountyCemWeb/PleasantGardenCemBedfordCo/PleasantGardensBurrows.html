  </b>This photo shows the old home that Banks A. &amp; Jemima (Casteel) Burrow 
lived in for many years. It is built of and contains the original log structure 
as it sits in decline. It was last occupied by my (Gerald) uncle and his wife, 
Roy and Jimmie Sue (Martin) Warren in 1985. Banks A Burrow was Roy Warren's 
g-grandfather. [Gerald Burrow 27 Jul 2013]<br>

</b>This birds eye view map from MS Bing shows the cemetery and the Banks a 
Burrow farm as labeled. Obviously this farm stayed in the hands of the 
children/grandchildren and then great grandchildren. <font size="2"><br>
</font></font><i><font size="2">Except for the cemetery this is all private farm 
property and should be left to the owner's disposition. The cemetery is also 
surrounded by private land but has a walking access from the road, but only for 
those to pay their respects. Updated from Gerald Burrow 27 Jul 2013.&nbsp; <br>
