  From the above map we are given the Pleasant Gardens Cemetery GPS location. We can see it 
is on Goose Creek Road southwest of Flat Creek Tn.<br>

  <font color="#000080"><b>Location: From Shelbyville go south on Hwy 
		231 several miles to the Center Church Road. Turn left there and go 
		about 3 1/2 mile and turn right on Goose Creek Road. Go about 2 1/2 miles 
and the cemetery is high upon a hill above you on your left out of sight. Go 
another hundred yards and look for the sign and park near the driveway to a 
house on the left side of the road. From there walk up the slope going 
east on the road provided for the cemetery to the locked gate. It is behind a 
locked gate so permission to enter is a must. The farmer here is deliberately 
destroying the road to the cemetery by adding locked chains and fences to the 
cemetery. He may think of it as security but I disagree. This will cause the 
road to disappear over time leaving the road to be no longer a drivable access 
up to the cemetery.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows more clearly the cemetery fence outline under a few trees upon the 
southeast side of the cemetery. The road up to the cemetery has been blocked so getting there 
is now something of a time consuming task involving help from others. <br>

This Aerial Map from MS Bing&nbsp; (a little closer in) shows the road up to the 
cemetery coming from the west. You cannot access the cemetery from directly 
below (north) on the road. That is private farm property and has no openings 
across the fence row. Your access is from your left down near where the barns 
are.</font></b><br>
