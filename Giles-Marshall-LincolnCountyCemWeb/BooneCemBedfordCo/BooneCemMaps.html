This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Boone Family Cemetery.
The nearest major town is Lynchburg in Moore County.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="BooneCemRd.jpg" width="1600" height="780"><br>
Location: Go southeast from Shelbyville Tennessee on Hwy 82 to Flat Creek and 
turn west (right) on New Center Church Road and almost immediately turn back 
south (left) on New Hermon/Flat Creek Road. Go less than 2 miles and look right 
into a small field for the large stones used to mark the graves. <br>

This aerial map from Google shows the cemetery on the west side of New Hermon Road in the 
open. As you go by it may be on a ledge above your head so keep a keen eye to 
avoid missing it. Also this map from Google has the cemetery plotted on the west 
side of that barn shown above so I corrected that using graphics. <br>
