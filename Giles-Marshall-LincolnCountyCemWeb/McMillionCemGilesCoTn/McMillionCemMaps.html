passing Shady Lane on the left. Go another 1/4 mile and turn left on Clear Creek 
Rd. Go about 1 mile and you will find yourself driving up a hill. Look left at 
the first home with a steep driveway. The cemetery is behind that particular home under 
the trees, but this is a recently built home. This was the former Myrtle Dunavant farm. Myrtle H Dunavant, 1876-1967

</font><font size="2" color="#008000" face="Comic Sans MS">This cemetery is in 
the backyard of Mr. Watson who needs privacy just as you and I. Visitors should 
not flood into this fenced backyard and disturb this family. I am sure a visit 
once every three to five years is OK and then you should be amiably welcomed. 
There is a possibly of a dog which will also discourage you from going without 
permission. CWA 30 Apr 2017.<br>
