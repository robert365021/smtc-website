*Aside from Arthur B., D.B.&nbsp; &amp; Lillie all of the other Thornton inscriptions were on one large 
monument which was not found either. Could this monument have been moved to another 
cemetery or just lost below ground, or perhaps destroyed by vandals. Does not show up 
in another cemetery on findagrave yet. However, this was inside 
of a rock wall and very dense in foliage and may still contain the tombstones. 
Footstones have recently been found by someone on Findagrave. Also the monument 
for George Hall and Rachel Norwood was not found leaving us finding only the two Flynt Children monuments. There was a dismantled box tomb without a top very 
near where I went over the rock wall so that seems to fit the time-fame to be for 
George Hall d. 1866 or maybe the Rachel Norwood monument after the roots 
decayed. <b><a href="IMG_5260.JPG">5260</a>/<a href="IMG_5261.JPG">5261</a></b><br>
The cemetery book mentions a D.B. Thornton and a 
Arthur B. Thornton with the same dates. One of them probably had wrong dates 
unless they were twins and they succumbed in something like a house fire.</p>
