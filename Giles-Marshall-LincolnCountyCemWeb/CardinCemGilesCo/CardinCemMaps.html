</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#000080">This map shows the
GPS location of the Cardin Cemetery.&nbsp; This cemetery is not detailed on the USGS records. The GPS Latitude
&amp; Longitude is slightly suspect. I went there and thought I plotted it 
correctly on my GPS computer, but when I came away I could match my GPS to the 
Topozone plotting and other mapping that showed the Aerial view depicting the 
little round grove of trees containing this cemetery. I do think this is correct 
within 250 yards. Sorry it was so far out in the field and my truck was 100 
yards from the cemetery the exact direction from I am not certain of. I think 
the plotting on this map was pegged where the truck was parked but maybe the 
plotting included a compensation for the distance to the cemetery and that was 
in the wrong direction. Another problem is the fields all have scattered trees 
and it is hard to pick out the round grove in the aerial views.</font></p>

</font><font size="2" color="#000080">Location: Highway 31S, left onto old Stage Road; on old Larkin
Cardin place before Hardy Road. Farm now belongs to Donny Moore. 
(1985)Directions today: Go Hwy 31 S to Hardy Road at the Ephesus Church of 
Christ and turn left (northeast). Travel up the hill a couple of miles going by 
Bethesda Cemetery on the right and terminate into Bunker Hill/Old Stage Coach 
Road and turn right. Follow that road and take the right turn or branch onto a 
continuation of Old Stage Coach Road. Find a field road which travels back south 
under the trees. When the road comes out into the open park and the cemetery 
will be in that field down the hill 100 yards ahead in the clump of trees 
southeast or southwest of you depending on where the farm road came out. I am 
uncertain of that direction as of now. <br>

This Aerial view shows where the GPS (marked with a G) is pegged and is 
obviously not where the cemetery is located. My selection is with a red check 
where I think the cemetery is located. The other yellow pointer is a possible 
location. So if you go there without instructions use this as a guide and you 
will find this cemetery, but don't forget this is private land. The cemetery is 
today inside a low barb wire fence. George Newman, who took me here, is the 
current president of the Giles County Historical Society and he knows where this 
cemetery is located, if he is still available.<i> <br>
