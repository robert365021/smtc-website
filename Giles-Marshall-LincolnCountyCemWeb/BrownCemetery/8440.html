Our focus is on the tall Compton family stone inside the northwest corner of the
wrought iron fence.<br>
<img border="0" src="IMG_8444-.JPG" width="238" height="578"><br>
Looking at the J. I. Compton inscription. That side is infested with Poison Ivy
Vines. Not a situation which gives me access to reading it. It is on the north
side of the stone whereas Mary's is on the south side. So we will be relying on
past transcriptionist here.<br>
