  A. E. (Andrew E.) Hollon and L. C. (Lewis Calvin) were brothers who never 
married. They lived together and they were buried together. <br>
<br>
Lewis C.'s obituary lists Sisters: Sarah J. &quot;Sally&quot;, Mary E. and Lottie. Since 
Sarah and Mary were the first two of the girls to die, they were buried 
together. And Lottie was buried by herself. These Five children as is stated in 
Mary's obituary never married and lived in the homeplace together. They were the 
children of Minerva Jane and William Hollon. William is not buried here. Other 
children of this couple were Neil of Athen Al. and James of Lawrenceburg TN. 
Lewis and Neil were both undertakers. These were the other brothers, that is Neil and 
James that are not buried here, Neil was an undertaker in Athens Alabama, and we 
suppose buried there. There might be a slight possibility that James was one also, 
he went to Lawrenceburg, Tn.<br>
<br>
There is an interesting carving on Minerva Jane Hollon's stone of a star between 
some partially opened gates and the words &quot;gates agar&quot; (This picture carving is 
only visible when the stone is wet and the light is just right) . Then at the 
bottom was her name Minerva Jane Hollon, and the dates B. June 6 1816 d Oct 7 
1904. The Pulaski citizen says there were 7 children but it does not 
give there names. The obit for A. E. lists brothers James and Neil and L. C's obit 
lists the three sisters and brother Neil. Mary, Lottie and Sally (Sarah) <br>
