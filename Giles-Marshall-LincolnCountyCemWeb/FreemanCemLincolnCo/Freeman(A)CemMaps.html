<b><font size="2" color="#008000">From Fayetteville go north out Hwy 231 
into Moore County and upon Chestnut Ridge. While traveling along Chestnut Ridge 
turn left on Poor Grab Chestnut Ridge Road and go back down the hill. When that 
road junctions with Pierce Road about a mile along the way, turn north (right) 
into Pierce Rd and go to the Freeman Cemetery on the right. With permission 
climb the hill to the top west of you and somewhat north to the cemetery with no 
formal headstones only fieldstones. I have not been here and cannot tell you 
that you will find this lost cemetery using these instructions.<br>
