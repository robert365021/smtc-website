MORRIS, Lester, 
</b>Died 1853, Aged 96 Years, (a 
Revolutionary War Soldier who was taken prisoner and held 6 months on board a prison ship 
by the British. During the Revolutionary War he served 6 years and 6 months. Later during the Civil War his 
tombstone was used by Federal Soldiers as a fireplace. A tombstone that is 
subject to heat eventually crumbles into dust. At the time of his death 
he was living with his daughter Mrs. Thomas A (Elizabeth) Westmoreland at 
Prospect.&nbsp; <b>

</b>At least ten standing (fieldstones) grave markers 
can be found here facing east and buried half way into the ground marking the head 
and/or foot of a grave; no information is known on who is buried 
under them. At least 5 of them are visible in these photos: <b>

This nearby location near present Prospect is known to be the first place where 
the early settlers for Prospect migrated too, &amp; lived and farmed. It lies along 
Ford Branch used as a water source by them. The land here is adjacent to the Elk River 
and is rich river bottom land and sought-after by the early settlers because of 
its great cultivation qualities.<br>
<br>
Interesting point about the other name Fort Hill Cemetery: I was told during the 
Civil War this place was occupied by Federal Troops who named the camp Fort 
Hill.<br>
