This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Thomas Sorrells Cemetery as N 35.35643 X W 
-86.59409.These coordinates are an estimate whereas the actual coordinates may 
be as much as 100 to 200 yards different. The yellow highlighted area is the 
most likely area to find this temporarily lost cemetery. You will not find the 
cemetery on the west side of the branch nor at the top of the hill according to 
Sherry.<br>

Fayetteville go north many miles on Highway 231 to Chestnut Ridge and turn left 
on Hwy 129 (Chestnut Ridge to Petersburg Rd). Follow that about 3 miles and turn 
left on Bledsoe Road and go something under three miles and turn left on Hannah 
Gap Road. The Hannah Gap Baptist Church is on your right just before you turn 
left. Follow Hannah Gap Road 7 tenths of a mile and look to the right (north) up 
a slope and at a Farm road. Turn in and </b></font><b>
<font color="#000080" face="Courier New">
follow the Farm Road north up the slope north about 100 yards. Next turn right 
(walking) 
and go down into the ravine and up the other side where these graves should be 
found on the side of the slope not far from the ravine. Marked there should be 
visible Cemetery vine (called Periwinkle). Look also for a place where the soil 
depth is enough for a graveyard since this is rocky type land. Go here in March 
or February when the Periwinkle is green and everything else is brown with dormancy. 
The 
cemetery will then stand out enough to be seen. You are looking for a flat grey 
granite marker and a sharp pointed fieldstone standing up (I hope) as shown in 
the photos above.</font><font face="Courier New"><br>

This modified and labeled Google view shows the field road and about the place 
to cross the stream of water. Do not use the yellow arrow as the exact place to 
cross this stream. It may not be exact enough. The cemetery may be found further 
north (up) than this crossing.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Courier New">Other Notes: The GPS to this cemetery is 
approximate. A team of persons went there 1 Jul 2015 and was unable to find the 
marker set 15 years ago by the Sherry Sorrells Finchum family, but a revisit 
will attempt again to find this place in the future on a February or March day. 
This cemetery is populated by a unique looking fieldstone and other marked 
graves including the flat granite marker set about year 2000 in this place. That 
should be located up the field road north a 100 yards or so and turn right and 
go down into the ravine and up the other side where these graves should be found 
on the side of the slope not far from the ravine. Marked there should be visible 
Cemetery vine and place where the soil depth is enough for a graveyard.<br>
