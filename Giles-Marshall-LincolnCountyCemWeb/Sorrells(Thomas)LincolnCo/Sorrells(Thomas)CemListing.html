<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="2" color="#800000">*Thomas Sorrells, Birth: 1793 or 1803, Wake County, North Carolina - Death: Apr 10, 
1870, Petersburg, Lincoln County, Tennessee.
Burial: Sorrells (Thomas) Cemetery, Hannah Gap Rd.,&nbsp; in Lincoln Co., TN, Casteel Property - now has an inscribed monument. He married 
1st Elizabeth Allison, (Abt 1805 - Abt 1828). married 2nd Elizabeth Russell (Abt 
1810 - Abt 1868) Lincoln Co., TN Birth year on the genealogy site showing 1803 probably finds that date closer to 
the truth than the fifteen year old date of 1793 used on the tombstone. We use 
the tombstone date here because it will likely outlast anything on paper or 
electronics.<br>
<br>
**Elizabeth Russell Sorrells, Birth: 1810, Tennessee - Death: 1868, Lincoln 
County, TN - Casteel Property.<br>
Burial: Sorrells (Thomas) Cemetery, Lincoln Co., TN Children of Thomas &amp; 
Elizabeth Sorrells: James E. Sorrells (1833 - 1908); Thomas Sorrells, (1835 - 1860); Adaline Alcy &quot;Pony&quot; Sorrells Young, (1839 - 1902); William Harvey Sorrells (1842 
- 1926).&nbsp; Texas researcher lists her as Becky Russell. A letter from her brother, T. P. C. 
&quot;Thomas&quot; RUSSELL in Obion Co., TN dated 26 May 1858 to Thomas addressed as 
brother-in-law stated that they owed some of the estate of their father to a man 
named John SISCO who lived in Stoddard Co., MO. He came for his share of 
Father's estate.&quot;<br>
<u>Another letter</u> dated 1 Oct 1859. Refers to a James (T.P.C.'s oldest child was 
named James) coming to visit them soon and should bring any news. He again asks 
them for money in regard to their settlement with John Sisco on their father's 
estate. Copies of these letters were received from John and Sherry Sorrells from 
a trunk of papers that belonged to Jack Sorrells in PoGrab, TN.<br>
<u>Copy of a receipt</u>: Received of Thos Sorrels by Gabriel Young $12 in full of my 
account for coffin this Apr 1 1868. signed by R. C. Blackwall. I believe that 
this would have been for Elizabeth. All of the children from the 1850 Lincoln 
Co., TN Census were still alive, except for son Thomas, Jr.. He was never 
married in Lincoln Co., TN as were his siblings. He did not appear in any other 
Census records. In 1868 he would have been 32 years old, but never listed as a 
landowner or Head of Household, therefore I believe he died prior to this 1868 
date, and the coffin was for Elizabeth. $12 would be for a full-sized coffin.
Her parents are not yet known.<br>
<br>
***Thomas Sorrells, Birth: 1835 - Death: abt 1860.
Son of Thomas (b. 1803) and Elizabeth &quot;Becky&quot; Russell (b. 1810). They are also 
buried here beside him. Death date actually is unknown by Sherry Finchum and was 
an average of (alive in 1850 census but missing from the 1870 census thus 1860.)
Status of grave: unmarked.&nbsp; son of Thomas Sorrells (1793 - 1870) &amp; Elizabeth Russell Sorrells (1810 - 
1868)
