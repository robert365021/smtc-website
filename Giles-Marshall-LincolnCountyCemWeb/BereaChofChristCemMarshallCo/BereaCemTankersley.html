  (HARDISON: Mark, Wm. Joshua, Samuel L., Ephriam.)<br>
  <br>
  ...1). #3022. Mollie Elizabeth Hardison. Born on 10 Nov 1861; d. 16 Aug 1903.
  Mar. Franklin Pierce Tankersley, He, b. 9 Feb 1853; d. 11 Jul 1938. He was a
  Christian minister and as such was called upon to perform a great many wedding
  ceremonies. He was, it seems, &quot;very careful to check the county in which
  a marriage license was issued when young couples cane to him to be married.
  His house was built almost on the county line. If the license was from Maury
  County he invited the couple into his home where he performed the ceremony. If
  the license was issued in Marshall County, he took them across the road and
  'did the job' beneath the 'marrying tree.. (Marshall County Historical
  Quarterly Vol. IX, 1978, p. 87). F. P. Tankersley was one of the original
  trustees who accepted the donation of 3 1/4 acres of land near Verona,
  Marshall Co., TN. from Newton McQuiddy on which to establish a Christian
  Church. This is the site of the present Berea Church of Christ and its
  cemetery. Frank and Mollie are buried therein. (See also page 253).<br>
