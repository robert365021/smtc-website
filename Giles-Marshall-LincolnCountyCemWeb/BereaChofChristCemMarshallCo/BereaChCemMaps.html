  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery in clear view with the monuments showing up
  as fuzzy white spots surrounded by the drive around the cemetery premises.
  Notice the church top showing up as a black shadow here with cars parked
  around probably related to a gathering the day this was photographed by
  satellite.<br>
  </font><font size="2">Do not go to this place if your intentions are not
  honorable. Respect must be shown at all times for those gone before us by
  respecting their monuments &amp; memorials.</font></b><br>
