Pulaski (TN) Citizen 24 Nov 1937<br>
On November 20, 1937, death fell upon R. E. Tucker, and when for him the silver 
cord of life loosed, his soul donned the beautiful robe of immortality and made 
a triumphant entry into his Heavenly Home. He did not fear death and he sings 
with the Psalmist, &quot;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I will fear no evil. Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.&quot;<br>
He was born on March 20, 1866, and lived most of his life in Giles County. On 
Nov. 25, 1889, he was married to Mary Inez Mayes and to this union were born 
five children, four of whom survive: Foster, Flournoy, Raymond and Mary Sam 
Tucker. He was a member of the Methodist Church.<br>
Funeral services were conducted at Bunker Hill, Sunday, Nov. 21st by Rev. 
Gibbons and the body was laid to rest in the McCracken Cemetery.<br>
