Lincoln County, Nov. 30, 1809, her maiden name being Collins. She was married at 
the age of twenty-two to John Lytle McCracken, and moved to this county, where 
she has since resided. Her husband died in 1857.<br>
Mrs. McCracken was survived by none of her five children, but at her burial were 
eleven grandchildren, and fifteen great-grandchildren, and two 
great-great-grandchildren. She is survived by one sister, Mrs. Harriet Wright, 
aged eighty-seven years.<br>
The burial was in the family graveyard at the old home place.<i><br>
