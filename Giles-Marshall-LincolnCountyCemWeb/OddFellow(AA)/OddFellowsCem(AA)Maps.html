        From the above map we are given the Odd Fellows Cemetery location and 
        can see the GPS location is about 200 yards south (but a bit eastward)&nbsp; of 
        the Elliot Cemetery. It is marked on this map and I added a 
        yellow arrow indicating its location.<br>
        <img border="0" src="OddFellowCemRd.jpg" width="1001" height="629"><br>
        Location - Back 200 yards southeat from the large Elliot Cemetery. 
        Another location detail: Highway 31 S., near cloverleaf on I-65.
        Road map above shows the Odd fellows Cemetery with a black arrow pointing it 
        out on this map.<br>

        This aerial view shows the subject cemetery south of the Elliot Cemetery 
        and it is about the same size but many graves are unmarked here.
