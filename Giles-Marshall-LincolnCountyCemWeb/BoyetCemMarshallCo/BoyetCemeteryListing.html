	<i>I (Faye Bradford) have pictures from Boyet Cemetery. These 
	came from my daughter. They were 
	made on June 9, 2012 by Pam McAlpin and Melissa Atkins, my two daughters. 
	Pam has wanted to join us on a cemetery trip for a long time 
	and as we were leaving our family reunion we drove back out Bear Creek Pike 
	and took a right at the end. We were enjoying the drive and were almost to 
	Lewisburg when Pam saw this little green Cemetery sign on the left side of 
	the road. All of the other cemeteries we saw&nbsp; before that we had 
	already done. <br>
	<br>
	This cemetery is so close to the (Ellington) airport that the fields behind it look like they are a part of it. You go 
	right through an opening in the very grown up fence row beside the cemetery sign 
	and you are in a field with just a path across it. If you look in front and 
	over to the right across the first field area you see a spot where the grass 
	is clipped very close, just enough to park a couple of cars and you see a 
	fenced in area where the cemetery is located. Pam made the photos as I told her how we 
	needed them and Missy did the chalking. She knew Pam wanted to do that 
	one. I told her also to get several area shots. </i></font></p>
	<p><i><font size="2">The cemetery is well maintained. 
	The grass was cut short. I do wish some of the greenery around a couple of 
	the markers could have been cut back. It is completely shaded by trees and 
	growth around the fencing and has at least two huge cedar trees right in the 
	middle.&nbsp; [Faye Bradford 22 Jun 2012.]<br>
