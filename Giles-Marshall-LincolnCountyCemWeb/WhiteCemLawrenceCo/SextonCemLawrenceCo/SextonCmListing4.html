	researching Sexton Cemetery, [compiled by Sue Davis]<br>
	William Harris, born August 1824, died _____, married 19 April 1847 in 
	Lawrence County, TN by W. R. Jones, J. P., to Mary Catherine Yerger/Yeager, 
	born February 1829, died 8 March 1888. Both are buried in Sexton Cemetery 
	near the Williams house, looking across to the cemetery, their graves are 
	toward the back.<br>
	Children of William Harris and Mary Catherine Yerger/Yeager Harris:<br>
	[1]. James Austin Harris, b. 1848. He once visited his sister Martha when 
	she lived at Anderson, Alabama. My mother remembers him. Only saw him once.<br>
	[2]. John B. Harris, b. 1854, married 17 January 1878 by M. E. Erwin, M.. 
	G., Lawrence County, TN Amanda Hays<br>
	[3]. Sarah Jane Harris, b. 25 March 1857, died 9 November 1933, married 18 
	November by D. G. Harrison, J. P., James Patton Williams, b. 30 March 1852, 
	died 24 August 1922. He was the mail-carrier at Appleton, TN at one time.<br>
	[4]. Virginia Edna Harris, b. 1860, d. before 1939. This is Cassie Harris� 
	mother. Cassie�s father was James M. Childress {below}<br>
	[5]. Martha Angeline Harris, b. 11 July 1863, died 30 April 1928, married 18 
	February 1880 by C. C. Laurence, M. G. , Lincoln County, TN to James M. 
	Childress, b. _____, d. 30 October 1891 {probable date given by Wm. Henry 
	Childers/Childress}. Wm. Henry changed the spelling of his name from 
	Childress to Childers. Martha A. Childers/Childress buried in Corum Cem.<br>
	<br>
	Cassie Harris had one daughter by R. L. Sakers. Her name was Dovie. Cassie�s 
	daughter, Dovie, visited John Childers/Childress once. My mother remembers 
	hearing this conversation: John kept referring to Cassie as �cousin Cassie�. 
	Dovie replied to him, �Uncle John, why do you keep calling her �cousin�? 
	She�s your sister!. Apparently Martha had taught her children to call Cassie 
	�cousin�. This is how I learned Cassie�s father�s identity.<br>
	I talked to a Littrell woman years ago. She and her sister were school 
	teachers. Neither was married. Miss Littrell {Dura} was living in a nursing 
	home in Decatur, AL near her nephew. She told me that Miss Edna {Cassie�s 
	mother} was a very good cook and house keeper. Miss Littrell�s father hired 
	Edna to keep house when his wife was abed during childbirth. This is how I 
	learned her correct name.<br>
	<br>
	Mrs. Helen Williams told me when we visited the first time: �I was present 
	when Miss Cassie was buried. She had always asked to be placed near her 
	mother. There was another grave beside Miss Edna�s, but I don�t know who 
	that was.� Could it be James M. Childress? We don�t know. <br>
	No one in the family knows either. No rocks mark burial places of Cassie or 
	her mother, Edna. The spot pointed out as Cassie�s resting place was just 
	inside the gate to the cemetery, a step or two to the left after entering 
	the gate. James Childress was killed by a shot from a gun when a group of 
	people rode up on horseback. Stories told: {i}. James stepped in front of 
	his brother/her brother to protect him. {ii}. James was involved in an 
	argument over a hound. {iii}. James was killed by a vigilante party upset 
	over James fathering a child by his wife�s sister.<br>
	<br>
	The parents of William or Mary Catherine Yerger/Yeager Harris are not known 
	to us at this time.<br>
	It is believed that Mary Catherine Yerger/Yeager and Elizabeth Yerger/Yeager 
	Sexton are sisters.<br>
	They lived on the same tract of land, and both are buried in the Sexton 
	Cemetery near the site of the Sexton/McMasters house.<br>
