  </font><font size="3" color="#006666">Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski 15+ 
	miles and turn left on Bryson Road (just before downtown Elkton) travel 
	nearly a mile and look left at a farm road &amp; cattle gate into a serious 
	farming operation. With help and permission to unlock the gate go thru that 
	and past the silos and continue northward into the forest on the farm road. 
	When the road bends back left take that and and when it bends back right 
	take that. Go across the branch and after that the cemetery will be on our 
	right up under the forest line covered in Periwinkle vegetation. Many of the 
	older cemeteries are clothed in Periwinkle. The farm road is about 3/4 mile 
	from the gate to the cemetery. Go there in dry weather because the road 
	during the wet season could cause a problem unless you have a jeep. See Mr. 
	George Newman who lives in Elkton for help in securing permission. He 
	does not own the land, but has connections to those that do. It was a 
	little tricky using phone permission. I actually went there with George 
	twice before finding the gate open.</font><font color="#008000" size="3"><br>

  This aerial view shows the Cemetery on the right side of a farm road off of 
	Bryson Road. A 
	yellow highlighted path is laid out here which you can follow. This path 
	follows a field road and must be used in dry weather. <i><br>
