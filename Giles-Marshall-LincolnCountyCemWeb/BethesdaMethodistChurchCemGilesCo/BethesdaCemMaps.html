Go south from Pulaski on Hwy 31 and pass the Ephesus Church of Christ. 
Immediately past that turn left or east on Hardy Road. Go a couple of miles 
almost to the Tarpley Shop aka Bunker Hill aka Old Stage Coach Road and look 
right to find the cemetery. The church building is on the left.<br>
<img border="0" src="BethesdaChurchCemAerial.jpg" width="1590" height="583"><br>
This aerial map shows the cemetery well maintained on the right across from the 
church building. This should be a public cemetery, but you may be scrutinized by 
the neighbors who rightly and regularly watch over the cemetery.<br>
