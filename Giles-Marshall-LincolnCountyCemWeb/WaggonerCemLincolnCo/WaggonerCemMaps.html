  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville take the Bypass 
to Hwy 64 and and go east toward Chattanooga. After a mile or so turn (left) 
north on the Lynchburg Hwy (Hwy 55) and go about 3 and 1/2 miles to the 
Booneville Road and turn left (or north). Go 1 mile and turn left or northwest 
on Gimlet Road. Go about 2 and 1/2 miles to the cemetery on your right inside a 
dense Privey Hedge thicket. The brush is so thick it is impossible to see all 
the cemetery assets in that environment.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows the plot where the cemetery resides next to Gimlet Road 
and on the other side might be a dog (vicious) breeding operation which that 
part is private but makes it very annoying to visit this cemetery when you 
wonder if you are in danger of a dog attack.<br>
