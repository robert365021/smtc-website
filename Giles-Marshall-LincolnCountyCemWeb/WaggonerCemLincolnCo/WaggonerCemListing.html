<p class="MsoNormal">As I photographed this cemetery behind the thicket where the 
cemetery resided were pit bull dogs snarling, growling and constantly lunging to 
break free and who knows what. That was some more music to work by. They were 
chained and/or penned right behind the cemetery. I am sure this was set up to 
frighten the cemetery visitor and it worked well. However if the dogs had broken 
free no doubt I would have had to injure them or be injured, because they were 
clearly vicious toward strangers. This cemetery was adjacent to the public road and needed 
no right of way for visitation. A machete would have been required to get the 
photographs, but because of the threat I mashed down enough brush to get the basic photographs and 
left, about a 10 minute endeavor. This is not to be 
considered a thorough survey compared to prior listings. It found all but the Pearson &amp; Moore 
stones and perhaps some of the fieldstones. <br>
Update from Gary to Mary Bob McClain. Gary lives in New Orleans and is working 
on clearing this cemetery during his vacation time. He says the dogs are not as 
bad as they seemed at first and he has identified most of the graves. 25 Sep
