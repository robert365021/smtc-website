Station to Brick Church 
	Rd) - GILES COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br>
<img border="0" src="HopewellCemGPS.jpg" width="1661" height="863"><br>
This map shows the coordinates of the Hopewell Cemetery which was the site of 
the Hopewell Presbyterian Church. Also the mapping for the Everbrite Cemetery 
for African Americans, still in use, is shown.<img border="0" src="HopewellCemRd.jpg" width="1920" height="976"><br>
Go Hwy 31 North to Buford Station-Brick Church Road and turn right. Travel that 
for about 1 1/2 miles and turn right into the Hopewell/Everbrite Cemeteries 
Road. When the Cemetery road begins to bend right toward the Everbrite Cemetery 
the Hopewell Cemetery is on your left, but sadly back into the thicket and weeds. 
It has been 
neglected for years.<br>

This aerial map shows the Everbrite cemetery maintained, but the Hopewell 
Cemetery is still abandoned and has been for maybe 75 years.<br>
