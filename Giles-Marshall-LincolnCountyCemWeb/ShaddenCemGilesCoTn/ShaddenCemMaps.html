This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Shadden Cemetery as N 35.26381 X W 
-87.05260.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="ShaddenCemRd.jpg"><br>
From Pulaski go north on Highway 31 about 4 miles, but first you will pass 
Industrial Loop Road, then Guthrie Rd/Pigeon Roost Rd &amp; lastly pass Annie White 
Road all on the left. After another mile you will see the home a white block 
house of what is today for Archie Williams a country cattle farmer and wife on 
the left upon the slope. Archie is the current caretaker of the Judge Lee farm 
where the cemetery resides. It is now owned by his daughter who lives off site. 
If your intentions are honorable Archie can allow or accompany you to the 
cemetery. This is the old Judge Robert Lee farm. The old home has been divided 
from the property and is now the New Canaan Ranch for treatment of substance 
abuse. If you have permission and a key to the double gate turn left at the long 
residential driveway before the New Canaan Ranch home and go about 500 yards 
passing thru the gate on the left. Follow the field road as it climbs the first 
hill then back slightly down and then back up again. The road is following a 
generally southwesterly direction. All this field road distance is about 1/3rd 
of a mile to the cemetery. When the road now going up a hill bends steeply to 
the right. Stop your vehicle and walk at 90 degrees from the road 30 yards into 
the woodland and you should see the small stones under a large dying Cedar tree,<br>
This is all known as Shadden Hollow.<br>

This labeled aerial map shows the cemetery under the trees. Follow the field 
road until it takes a sharp bend to the right then stop and walk 30 yards left 
under the trees. Notice several leaning trees mostly leaning to the right. Unless cut the large dying Cedar tree standing over the 
cemetery will last another 20 to 40 years but may fall. Hopefully it will not 
cover up the small stone for Jimmy Shadden.<br>
