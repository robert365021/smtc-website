				Location: From Pulaski go Highway 64 East and turn right on Bunker Hill Road. 
Go several miles and under I-65. At Bunker 
				Hill turn on Lloyd Road east (left). Go 1/2 mile and turn left 
into a the private driveway. This is the old Ward Minatra place, 1884), the home of Dr. Harold Honeycutt 
(1985) and current owners. I did not get the name but the current owners are 
very pleasant folks who evidently are maintaining the cemetery and are pleasant 
to visitors of the cemetery as they were to me. <br>

This aerial map shows the Minatra Family Cemetery marked with a red check near 
the farm of the current owners. The old water well is seen as a spot on the west 
side of the driveway just before it begins the loop. Please respect this as 
private property.<br>
