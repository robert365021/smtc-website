		Rebecca lost her father when she was not yet three years old. As her 
		mother never remarried, she was raised as the only child in the farming 
		and slave-owning household of her mother and grandparents, but with an 
		extended family nearby. We know that she attended school briefly in 
		Athens, Alabama about 1839, staying with her uncle John Ramsey Denty and 
		his wife Matilda. She later attended the Pulaski Female Institute until 
		her eighteenth birthday.<br>
		<br>
		On 4 Oct 1852 she married James Abernathy at her mother's home in Giles 
		County, Tennessee. James, born on 6 Nov 1825 in Brunswick County, 
		Virginia, was the son of William David and Mary Beckwith Abernathy. The 
		groom moved into his mother-in-law's house and, turning his own family 
		farm over to his younger brothers, began to very successfully manage and 
		increase the Denty acreage on Big Creek. By the 1860 Census, James was 
		listed as head of household, with real and personal property valued at 
		$16,500 and $22,000. On the Slave Schedule that year, he was shown as 
		the owner of nineteen slaves.<br>
		<br>
		In December 1861, James enlisted in what would become Company A, 11th 
		Tennessee Cavalry, later consolidated into the 1st Tennessee Cavalry. He 
		returned home after the Battle of Chattanooga in late November 1863 with 
		the rank of Captain.<br>
		<br>
		Despite the war and its aftermath, the farm and the children raised 
		there continued to flourish. The Abernathys' built a school and provided 
		land for a church. James bought a mill that would become known as the 
		Arlington Mills, and later the name of Arlington was applied to the farm 
		as well. On 22 Mar 1901, sixty-eight year old Rebecca died of pneumonia 
		&quot;on the same premises where she was born and married&quot;. The Pulaski 
		Citizen, The Giles County Record, and the Christian Advocate all carried 
		her obituary, the Christian Advocate aptly describing her: &quot;Whatsoever 
		her hands found to do (and they were always finding), she did with her 
		might . . . A good and faithful wife, an unselfish neighbor, a sincere 
		Methodist.&quot; Captain James died only two months later.<br>
		<br>
		The Abernathys had twelve children , eight of whom lived past infancy:<br>
		<br>
		Elizabeth Denty Abernathy, born on 27 Aug 1857, graduated from Tennessee 
		Female College in 1877 and became a schoolteacher, but never married. 
		She died in Giles on 13 Aug 1932. Elizabeth delved into the family 
		history and preserved and expanded the heritage left to her by her 
		mother.<br>
		<br>
		Mary Hardaway Abernathy, born in 1863, married Dr. H. Taylor Campbell on 
		20 Nov 1888. The couple moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where Dr. 
		Campbell died in 1918 and Mary in 1934. They are buried in Mt. Olivet 
		Cemetery in Nashville.<br>
		<br>
		Liles Edward, born in 1866, became a cattle trader and magistrate. He 
		married Sarah Abernathy Cunningham on 30 Jun 1917 in McKinney, Texas. He 
		died in Giles County in 1936.<br>
		<br>
		Named after her aunt Susan Kent Denty of Huntsville, Alabama, Susan Kent 
		Abernathy was born on 25 Apr 1868. On 20 Nov 1907 she married John Henry 
		Stevenson. Susan died in Pulaski, Tennessee on 11 Oct 1947 and was 
		buried in Elkton, Tennessee.<br>
		<br>
		Adelia Boisseau, born on 2 Mar 1870, married John Henry Rogers, a 
		farmer, on 17 Jan 1893. Widowed in 1922, &quot;Desie&quot; died in Nashville, 
		Tennessee on 5 Apr 1922.<br>
		<br>
		Born on 8 Mar 1872, Margaret Jackson Abernathy never married. She died 
		on 8 Jan 1901 in Nashville, Tennessee.<br>
		<br>
		Florence Irvine was born on 3 Jan 1874. She married farmer and stockman 
		(and cousin) Joseph Cayce Abernathy on 23 Oct 1900. It was their 
		daughter Rebecca Denty Abernathy (1901-2001) who discovered the cache of 
		Denty letters in the possession of her Campbell cousins. Florence died 
		on 24 May 1961 and was buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Giles County.<br>
		<br>
		William DeLacey Abernathy, born on 28 Feb 1880, married Elizabeth Buford 
		in 1919. Engaged in farming, William became a sheep expert. He died in 
		1965 in Pulaski, Tennessee.<p align="center"><i>Information compiled by
