 &nbsp;<b>This photo was taken looking southwest.We are
 standing on the hill top but not at the highest point. That is back to our
 right
 400 yards or so. Blue Branch Road is to our left and in front of us also about
 200 yards. The stones here are five in number. From left to right: Emma Frances
 West Coffee (Daughter), Manervia West,J. Polk West (Son), Manerva Samuels West
 (Mother) &amp; Samuel<br>
 A. West (father). </b><b><i>Photo taken

<b>This photo is of the cemetery and two of its
descendents. They are L to R, Wayne Austin, Administrator of this site, of
Alabama &amp; Linda Stevens Munroe of Bartow Florida. I believe the logging
company installed the caution tape to prevent damage to the cemetery. <i>Photo

This view looks west at the memorials. Here we can clearly see the
small footstones in front of the main headstones all facing east. This cemetery
has been burned over. There are bits of burned wood all around. It is not good
to burn a cemetery as it softens the stone and may set them it up for future
crumbling.&nbsp;
