Location: Highway 245 north to Blue Branch Road. Turn right (east) on
Blue Branch Road and go about a mile and turn left (north) into a logging road just
back from the
place where Blue Branch Creek crosses onto the road. There
will be a concrete bridge there. Standing at the intersection of Blue Branch Road
and the Logging Road look northwest upon the hill into the trees and though you
cannot see the cemetery it is about 175 yards northwest upon the hill. If one goes north
down the logging road about 200 yards there will be another logging road
circling back southwest up the hill that passes within 30 feet of the cemetery on the
right.</b>

by the descendents of the interred in this cemetery. Visited on a stormy &amp;
rainy day 3 Apr 2008. They were: Linda &amp; Bruce Munroe of Bartow, Florida;
Wayne Austin of Madison Alabama; L.M. &amp; Eva Coffey of Columbia Tennessee.
LM, Linda &amp; Wayne are West/Coffee descendents.<br>
Our thanks go to Ella Virginia Coffee Stevens, b. 1924, mother of Linda Munroe
who gifted us with her keenly descriptive memory, known since her childhood, to
accurately describe for us where we would find this cemetery. Thanks Cousin
&amp; Mother, Ella Virginia, we love you, and wish for you to continue to grow
stronger each day. 7 Apr 2008.<br>
This is a classic example of why we should treasure the memories of our elders.
We might never have gotten any closer than 1 square mile of finding this lost
historical treasure without her help.<br>
