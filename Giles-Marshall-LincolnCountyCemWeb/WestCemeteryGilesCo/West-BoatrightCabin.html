When this cabin sat over next to the West Cemetery the last known family to live 
there were the of James Hoyt and Katie (Fleeman) Boatright family. This was 
along the north side of Blue Branch Road back into a (now) log road on the 
right. This is in District 14 of Giles County, Tennessee and is the location as 
Linda Munroe's Mother (Ella Virginia Coffee Stevens) remembered. The cabin was 
bought and moved to the LairdLand Farms and restored for a bed &amp; breakfast. Mr. 
Blackburn who owns that says it was indeed the West Cabin years before it was 
owned by the Boatrights. Its history likely goes back into the early to mid 
1800s when the Samuel West b. 1809 family lived here. It is hard to say what 
order the large Samuel West family occupied the cabin because this family 
started dying out in the 1860s and continued to do so into the early 1900s. I 
can't say who lived here but one may have been William Fine Coffee who was 
married to Samantha Virginia Wiley. She died and he remarried to Mary Agnes 
Watson the lady in this photo below shown with his children by his first wife. </span>

it is not known where they lived but both died very young (1867) and Isaac was
