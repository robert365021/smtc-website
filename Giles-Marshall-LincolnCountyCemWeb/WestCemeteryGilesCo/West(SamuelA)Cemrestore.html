<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><u>Restoration
&amp; Maintenance of the West Cemetery.<br>
</u><br>
The owner of the Frank Duncan house 500 yards northwest of the cemetery has not
bulldozed it yet as mentioned he would do. That is not a large structure but
goes back to at least the mid 1800s and may be also be the original West
residence. He has secured the doors indicating he wants no one to enter the
building.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Upon
arriving and climbing the hill going southwest on the new logging road I first
roped the cemetery parameter with bright colored nylon string and plastic. The
old caution tape someone had installed earlier had disintegrated and lost its
bright colors. Going to try to maintain that over time and look for some
permanent bright way to protect the cemetery from being lost in the brush. Could
cut the trees there but the thickets would take over. None of the trees are
threatening the graves so no need to cut them unless they become brittle and
start dropping limbs on the stones.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;When
I inspected the memorials </span>on that
Wednesday 4/22/09 I found problems that needed immediate attention. The Minerva
West stone was found as expected scattered out on the ground in three pieces.
However, I was surprised to find the Emma F. Coffee stone had been uprooted and
fallen. I think that may have been from the high wind we had the other day here
in Middle Tennessee. I came mostly prepared and spent about 2 hours repairing
many things, but left future needs for lack of supplies.<br>
<br>
To begin with I removed the stone from the ground, dug out and leveled the hole,
and reset the Emma Coffee stone. I stood it up added soil and tamped the area to
hopefully hold it permanently upright.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Next
the broken Minerva West stone was tackled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I dug the base out of the ground. It was a large base and required much
shoveling and prying to get it out. I cleaned the base and the two top parts and
epoxy<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>glued the two broken top parts
together. I set about cutting and clearing the roots from the nearby Hickory
Tree that had rendered the base out of level. Then I set the clean base back
into its hole and leveled it with nearby stones and filled and tamped (packed
the soil) around it. Next I reset and lightly glued the top back into the base.
I left that insecure because the top was much too small to fit tightly into the
base opening. I will need to go back with cement of some kind to fill that base
cavity to permanently secure the top into the base. I believe the top will stand
into the base for a time without any help, but it will eventually break from the
glue &amp; lean back or forward and may in time break the stone again without
further efforts.<br>

right thru the age description &amp; reads 84 Y.R.S 2 DYS. Notice the large
space in the base opening.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Upon
inspection of the Samuel West memorial stone it was found to be breaking up
&amp; peeling off near where it is touching the ground. That is bad and is the
result of the fire that swept thru there and rendered the stone brittle. I think
I have a solution for that. That is a formula that seals the stone given me by
Dan Sumner Allen III. It is a mix of hydrated lime, white Portland cement and
white sand. I think it is 8 parts sand, 4 parts hydrated lime and, 1 part white
Portland cement watered down to a slimy mix and smeared all over the face of the
stone being careful to leave no residue around the inscription. Dan called this
sealing the stone. However it is important not to use regular concrete sealers
as those will cause harm. I will then take that same mix but reduce the water
content to make it a 1500 lb mortar mix and fill in the crumbling areas at the
bottom of the stone and smooth that in to make it appear it was a part of the
original stone. This will fill the crumbled out areas. Hopefully that effort
will keep the cemetery for at least a time.<br>
