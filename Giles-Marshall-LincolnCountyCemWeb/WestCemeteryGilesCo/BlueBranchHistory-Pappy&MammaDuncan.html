The branch usually was dry until the rains came and the path to the old Duncan
homestead went through this dry creek bed. Two Giles County born folks, Frank
Duncan and Mary Ella Trice, made their home here for over 50 years. Frank
Duncan, born in 1875, to Andrew and Nellie Purina Ball Duncan, met his bride in
Giles County. Mary Ella Trice, born in 1876, to Samuel Crinion and Sara Gibson
Trice, married Frank on August 1, 1897 in Giles County.<br>
<br>
They made their home on Blue Branch, in a house that never had running water or
electricity during their lifetimes. Frank, known as &quot;Pappy&quot; to his
grandchildren, was a farmer. His money crop was tobacco. Behind their home on
land that is now wooded were fields of tobacco. Pappy planted the tobacco seeds
in a hot bed that he covered with a cheesecloth-like fabric. When the tobacco
slips were large enough for transplanting, he would move the small slips to the
field. He owned mules for working the farm and a horse to pull their buggy. His
granddaughter, Ella Virginia Coffee, remembers riding in the horse-drawn buggy
to go to church. When Ella and her sister, Marguere, stayed with their
grandparents on Saturday nights, Mammy would roll the girls' hair up on rags to
make curls for Sunday.<br>

feet&nbsp;from a tiring day. I can remember that often was one of the highlight of the
day&nbsp;because it was always so refreshing in the days before Air Conditioning.

<font size="2">The old Duncan home place still standing today in 3 Apr 2008, but
sadly abandoned with its many memories fading with the past generations. It is apparent from the rock chimney with
clay instead of concrete used to
bond the stones together that the old house was built well back into the 1800s. We
believe one of the three prominent families in this Hollow probably built the
house. They were the James Boatwrights, Samuel A West, the Hickmans or even the
Samuel Trice. It is
actually built as if three buildings were connected with two separate additions
with a common roof-line.</font><font size="2"><br>
<br>
</font>Four children, Emma Lillian (1898), Lecie
(1903), Roy (1906), and Rufus Byrum (1911) were born to Frank and Mary Ella. The
children walked to school down Blue Branch road to a school in the Yokley area.
Emma Lillian, the oldest, told her daughters about having to stay at home from
school on Mondays so she could help her mother with the washing. At this school
the Duncan's oldest child, Emma Lillian, met her husband-to-be, Marvin Coffee,
son of William F. &amp; Samantha Virginia Coffee.<br>
<br>
Mary Ella, known as &quot;Mammy,&quot; filled the Duncan yard with flowers�snowball
bushes, hydrangeas, sweet pea flowering vines, and altheas. Every year she
whitewashed the tree trunks in their front yard as high up as she could reach.
Mammy grew asparagus just for the fern foliage. As most women in her era, she
canned fruits and vegetables and made her own butter in a wooden churn. The
butter and milk were kept in a spring near the barn when the weather was hot.<br>
A peddler traveled Blue Branch Road with his wares such as sewing thread,
vanilla extract, baking powder, candy, and many other useful household items.
Mammy and Pappy's granddaughter, Ella, recalls how her grandmother gave her eggs
from the Duncan farm to trade with the peddler for candy.<br>

Each day Pappy and Mammy would bring water in tin buckets from the spring up to
their house for cooking and washing. To heat the water, they used a wood stove.
In the winter the house was warmed from a fireplace in the main room, which was
large enough to hold backlogs kept burning all winter long. All the cooking in
the kitchen was on the wood stove. Because there was no electricity, the Duncans'
used kerosene lamps for light at night. Uncommon for the time, the house had a
separate dining room in the back. However, the upstairs was unfinished.<br>
<br>
Pappy died in 1951 in the backyard of their home on Blue Branch. Mammy, who died
nine years after her husband, lived her final years in the homes of her
children. Both are buried at Gibsonville Cemetery.<br>
