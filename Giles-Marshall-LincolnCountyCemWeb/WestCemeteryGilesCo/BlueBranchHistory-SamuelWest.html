<br>
Samuel A. West was born on January 28, 1809 in Spartanburg County, South
Carolina to Walter and Nancy Ligon West, along with five known brothers and
sisters--Elizabeth, Lydia Ann, Mary Ann, James W. and Walter O. The elder Walter
was the son of Joseph West, born in 1742 in Frederick County, Maryland. Joseph
and Mary Offutt, born May 24, 1746 in Prince George's County, Maryland, were
married in Maryland in 1765. The couple migrated to Spartanburg County, South
Carolina and were the parents of eleven children-Kinsey, Elisha, Burgess,
Walter, Cassandra, Elizabeth, Anna, Thomas Joseph, John, Nancy and Stephen. One
of Joseph's sons, Walter, and Walter's wife Nancy Ligon, journeyed from
Spartanburg District, South Carolina to Giles County Tennessee. Their oldest
son, Samuel A. West, is first found on the 1840 Federal Census, Giles, as a head
of household. He received a land grant for 341 acres in 1849 and an additional
10 acres in 1850 in Giles County.<br>
Samuel married Minerva Ann Samuels, a lifelong resident of Giles County, in
1833. To their union were born ten children, John W., David K., Homer R., Emma
Frances, Martin V., Mary Tennessee, James K. Polk, Andrew Jackson, Minervia A.
and Samuel Markus. The Samuel West farm was located in the 14th Civil District
of Giles County, enumerated as the northern subdivision on the 1860 Federal
Census, near the town of Lynnville.<br>
Records preserved at the National Archives reveal a story of the West family
during the turbulent Civil War times in Giles County. Under the Act of Congress
of March 3, 1871, claims could be made by loyal citizens for monetary
reimbursement of supplies furnished to Union troops during the Rebellion.
Samuel's brother, Walter O., filed a claim as executor of his brother's estate.
The documents tell a story of family sacrifice and hardship, as was common to
many families living at this time.<br>
<u><b><br>
Receipt from Lieutenant Watkins<br>
</b></u>A receipt from a Union army officer, written by Lieutenant J. {John} F.
Watkins of the 8th Iowa Calvary Regiment, detailed the Union army's seizure of
1000 pounds of salt pork from Samuel's smokehouse for the use of &quot;U. S.
soldiers.&quot; The lieutenant's regiment belonged to the 1st Brigade, 1st
Division of the Calvary, Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Brigadier General
Croxton. The 8th Iowa unit camped near the West farm in Lynnville on Christmas
Eve and Christmas Day in 1864. One week prior to their encampment in Giles, the
soldiers had participated in the Battle of Nashville. Records also show this
unit at Campbellsville on November 24, near Columbia on November 24-27, and in
Franklin on November 30. Soldiers in the 8th Iowa regiment later joined other
troops in the infamous Wilson's Raid to Macon, Georgia.<br>
When the soldiers came to seize the salt pork, Minerva remarked to Lieutenant
Watkins that the confiscation would be very hard and her children would suffer
from it. The Union officer spoke very kindly to Minerva and asked for a pen and
ink to write a receipt so that the family could receive reimbursement. At the
time, the salt pork was worth 20 cents per pound, according to testimony.
Minerva stated that the officer and her husband agreed on the 1000 pounds
because her husband had weighed eight hogs. The salt pork was taken by men on
horseback. Minerva testified she was told there were 5000 soldiers in the
regiment. She knew there were a great many. According to Minerva, her husband
sent the receipt to Washington City, and if it was not on file there, she did
not know where it was.<br>
Samuel Markus, the twenty-five year old (in 1878) youngest son of Samuel and
Minerva, testified that his father gave the receipt from Lieutenant Watkins to
his father's attorneys for collection. He said it was good fat pork that had
been salted three or four weeks. Samuel Markus related that the soldiers took
the salt pork one, two or three pieces at a time all in one day. He described a
very large body of soldiers involved in the removal.<br>
This incident was not the only time the family had experienced soldiers
commandeering their property. Minerva told how Confederate soldiers had taken
her husband off and threatened him, seized two horses and some corn on the well
known Wheeler's raid. Just as their property was seized, Minerva told of two
sons who were conscripted in 1863 or 1864 into the Rebel Army. She testified
that she told her sons she was opposed to them entering the Confederate Army and
said &quot;if they had to fight to fight under the stars and stripes.&quot; She
said she never contributed to their outfit, nor did she aid the rebels in any
way. Minerva related that she always furnished the Union soldiers with clothing
she had to spare when they came to her house, which was often. She denied ever
being in any social society for the benefit of the Confederacy.<br>
<u><b><br>
Confederate Records of West Men from Giles County<br>
</b></u>Although Minerva's testimony does not name the sons who were forced to
join the Confederate Army, civil war records at the National Archives show three
West men, whose names match Samuel and Minerva's sons, listed as members of
Confederate units. David K. West enlisted October 13, 1862 in Company D,
Holman's Battalion, Partisan's Rangers, at Pulaski, Giles. This unit eventually
became Company K, 11th Regiment (Holman's), Tennessee Calvary. The records for a
D. K. West in the 11th Tennessee Calvary show he enlisted October 18, 1862 by
Captain Jim Rivers. He was detailed in the hospital at Raymond, Georgia in March
through April 1863, May through June 1863, and December 1863 through June 1864.<br>
Two other West men, M. V. West and J. P. West, both enlisted as privates in
Company I, 3rd Tennessee (Clack's) Infantry in November, 1862 within 2 days of
each other, by Lieutenant Locke in Giles County. It is believed that these men
were brothers Martin V. West and James K. Polk Westï¿½and sons of Samuel and
Minerva. The record of M. V. West shows him on detached duty on the muster roll
of May through June, 1862. Additionally, muster rolls from July 1, 1863 until
the following February of 1864 show M. V. West as being absent, sick and in a
hospital. There is also a card marked Prisoner of War, but further information
about this is not given in the record. The last muster roll in February 1864
states he was &quot;sent to the hospital July 3rd/63. Not since heard
from.&quot;<br>
Civil war service records for J. P. West indicate he enlisted as a private in
Company I, 3rd Tennessee (Clack's) Infantry on November 8, 1862. He was sick in
the hospital on muster rolls dated February 20, 1863, and May through June 1863.
He is listed as absent without leave on the muster rolls of July through August
1863 and September through October 1863. Finally, the last record indicates he
deserted from Lauderdale Springs, Mississippi on the muster roll dated November
to December 1863.<br>
<u><b><br>
Passes Through the Federal Lines<br>
</b></u>In order for the claim by Walter to be approved, the loyalty of his
brother to the Union had to be established. Several documents are found in the
file. One was a pass dated October 22, 1864 to the &quot;Grand Guards and
Pickets, Pass Samuel West through the lines, Good for 5 days.&quot; Another
Pickets Pass from the Provost Marshals Office, Pulaski, Tennessee, May 16, 1865,
was written for &quot;Samuel West and conveyance good for 30 days by order Gen.
Johnson, B. F. Price, Lieutenant and A. P. M.&quot; On the same date, a
handwritten note was scribed from R. W. Johnson of the Head-Quarters, Sixth
Division, Calvary Corps, M. D. M. stating &quot;Pulaski, May 16, 1865, Samuel A.
West is authorized to keep and hunt with a Rifle and shotgun with a limited
supply of ammunition for each arm.&quot; Lee had surrendered to Grant in
Appomattox on April 9, 1865, formally ending the Civil Car, but the times were
still turbulent in Giles. It can be inferred that citizens in Giles needed
permits from the occupying forces to carry arms.<br>
<u><b><br>
His Brother's Testimony<br>
</b></u>In addition to the testimony of Minerva, Samuel's brother Walter told
his account of the facts. Stating he was sixty-one years old, he testified he
was a farmer who had lived all his life in Giles County except eight years.
Walter told the commissioner that he lived within ten miles of Samuel's farm
during the war. He said Samuel told him in 1863 on their way to the house of
Samuel's son, John, and at other times, that the war was all wrong and that he
was opposed to it. According to Walter, Samuel told him they would have to go
back to the Union and that he wanted the south to go back. Samuel often spoke of
the troubles of the war and that he wished the south had not rebelled. Minerva
was described as agreeing with her husband, and who always expressed herself in
favor of the Union. Walter said Minerva did not talk much, but was positive and
emphatic in what she had to say. Further testimony from Walter revealed that his
brother's public reputation was that of a loyal man to the Union. A copy of the
Oath of Allegiance signed by Samuel on Feb 24, 1864, and signed by the Captain
of 89th Iowa and Provost Marshal, gave further testimony of Samuel's loyalty.
Another copy from E. S. Nixon dated Nov. 3, 1863 certified that Samuel A. West
had taken the Oath of Allegiance to the Government of the United States and had
filed a bond for $2000. Similarly, a receipt from Edward W. Rose, Clerk of the
County Court of Giles, dated July 1865, certified Samuel A. West as a qualified
voter of said county. Therefore, he was entitled to a vote in the election of
1865 under the Brownlow administration.<br>
<u><b><br>
Testimony from Neighbors<br>
</b></u>J. W. Shields, sixty-six years old, was a lifelong resident of Giles who
testified to Samuel's loyalty. Shields was not related to Samuel West. He had
known Samuel for 30 years before his death and lived within 5 miles of the West
farm during the war. Shields, a notary public, said Samuel was known by the
community as a Union man. He stated that Samuel did not do anything at all that
identified with the Confederate government.<br>
Another neighbor, sixty-three year old Robert S. Montgomery, was a tailor and
Postmaster who had lived in Giles County for the last 40 years. He testified
that he was not related to Samuel, but had known him for 25 years before his
death. He, too, lived about 5 miles from Samuel during the war. Montgomery
testified that Samuel was considered a Union man and had that reputation.<br>
<u><b><br>
Testimony from a Rebel Captain</b></u><br>
The last deposition was from a former captain in the Rebel army, R. {Robert} A.
Mitchell. Confederate records indicate Mitchell was a Captain in 3rd (Clack's)
Tennessee Infantry, Company B. At the time of his testimony, he was thirty-eight
years old. Having lived in Lynnville most of his life, he stated he was a
merchant and did not live near Samuel. Mitchell testified that while he was in
the Rebel army, it was &quot;the common understanding among all of us soldiers
that the claimant was a strong and emphatic Union man and he was so recognized
and treated by us.&quot; The Rebel captain told about a time in 1863 or 1864
that reinforced Samuel's loyalty to the Union. &quot;While we were south my
father came home to get us some clothing and in coming to Lynnville passed by
{the} claimant's house. The federal troops were at that time stationed at
Lynnville. My father was reported to these troops and was caused a great deal of
trouble and it was always understood that Samuel A. West reported him. And if we
could have gotten hold of him at the time, we would have made it the most
unhealthy act of his life.&quot; The 54 page confederate record for R. A.
Mitchell has several pages of requisitions he made for clothing for his troops.
Captain Mitchell was captured at Fort Donelson and held as prisoner of war at
Johnson's Island, Ohio. His record also shows he was wounded in September 1864
near Lovejoy Station. In his deposition for the West claim, he stated that
Samuel and &quot;all his kin except one were strong Union people.&quot; His
deposition does not indicate who this one might have been. Perhaps it was David
K. West, the third son.</font></p>
<p align="center"><u><b>The Receipt Found<br>
</b></u>On February 28, 1878, the day after Minerva, Walter and Samuel Markus
testified, an affidavit was given to the commissioner by Ewing, attorney and
agent for the West claim. The affidavit stated that after the examination of
Mrs. Minerva West, a receipt purported to be the original receipt given by
Lieutenant Watkins was handed to Ewing by Captain John C. Lester, an attorney at
Pulaski. The receipt was among some other papers and &quot;its existence was not
known to the affiant (Ewing) until that day when it was accidentally
found.&quot; Another affidavit, signed by two sons of Minerva--Martin V. West
and James P. West-- was dated May 29th 1865 and included in the claim. The
brothers swore that the pork taken by J. F. Watkins was salted and packed and
worth in the market at the time taken at least 20 cents per pound. This
affidavit was sworn to and subscribed before Daniel G. Anderson, Justice of the
Peace. Martin and James are the same men that were believed to have been
conscripted into confederate service.<br>
<u><b>Claim Approved<br>
</b></u>Jones and Ewing were local attorneys for the West claim, No. 19545.
Testimony was taken before C. W. Merrill, Esq., U. S. Special Commissioner at
Pulaski, Giles County, on February 27 and 28, 1878. The claim was allowed on
March 8, 1879 and $200 was approved for reimbursement to Walter O. West,
executor of Samuel A. West, deceased.<br>
<u><b>West Graves Found in 2008<br>
</b></u>The graves for Samuel A. West and Minerva Ann West have recently been
found by two descendants--Wayne Austin and the author on April 3, 2008. The
author's eighty-four-year old mother, Ella Virginia Coffee Stevens, remembered
playing as a child near a cemetery on a hilltop on Blue Branch Road. This
unknown cemetery was in the general location where it was believed the West
family lived. Ella's remarkable memory of the location almost 60 years later
proved to be the piece that led to the discovery of the lost graves for these
five West ancestors. Ella never knew as a child that the graves were her own
great-great grandparents. In the small cemetery are the graves of Samuel and
Minerva, as well two daughters-- Emma F. (West) Coffee, wife of Isaac Hamilton
Coffee, and Minervia A. West. One son, J. Polk West is also buried alongside his
family. This West Family cemetery is not listed in any Giles County Cemetery
compilations to date. Wayne, the author, and Ella descend from Samuel and
Minerva's daughter, Emma Frances West.<br>
