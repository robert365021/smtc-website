<p align="center"><b><font color="#000080" size="2">WEST (SAMUEL A.) FAMILY CEMETERY,
BLUE BRANCH ROAD, GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
</b><b><img border="0" src="West(Samuel)CemRd.jpg" width="981" height="465"><br>
</b>
 &nbsp;<b>Location: Highway 245 north to Blue Branch Road. Take a right (east) turn on
Blue Branch Road and go about a mile and turn north into a logging road just at the
place where Blue Branch Creek crosses onto the south side of the road. There
will be a concrete bridge there. Standing at the intersection of Blue Branch Road
and the Logging Road look northwest upon the hill into the trees and though you
cannot see the cemetery it is about 175 yards away upon the hill. If you climb
the hill from there be extra careful the hill is very steep. If one goes north
down the logging road about 200 yards there will be another logging road
circling up the hill southwest that passes within 30 feet of the cemetery on the
right.&nbsp;The GPS Coordinates are: </b>

I have placed the map coordinates on this cemetery. That should be accurate
enough for the Geological Mapping Survey to update their records. Studying
the above map will show a branch of the Blue Branch creek coming from up a hollow after Blue
Branch crosses from north to south on the north side. Today there is a
logging road there that can be traveled. In years past the old Boatwright Log
House stood in that hollow.&nbsp;<br>

This is an aerial map view that shows the logging roads highlighted in yellow.
Notice the Stan Hollow road is just down the road. Do not confuse this location with
that also northwesterly branch road of Blue Branch called Stan Hollow Road. Stan
Hollow Road is just east of this Hollow and branch highlighted in yellow.<br>

This map better defines the area for finding this difficult to find cemetery. To 
get to the cemetery from this map turn just before the bridge over the Blue 
Branch Creek and follow the Boatright Cabin Rd a couple hundred yards and there 
will be a logging road branching backwards up the steep to your right. If your 
vehicle can climb that you will come out beside the cemetery. If not climb it on 
foot and the cemetery will be on your right after you reach the highest point on 
the logging road. The logging road up the hill does not show up on the above map 
but is depicted on the previous map.<br>
