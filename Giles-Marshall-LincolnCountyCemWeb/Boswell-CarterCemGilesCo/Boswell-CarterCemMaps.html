This Aerial view shows the cemetery in a big open field. Mr. Cribbs maintains it 
and has done a phenomenal job of clearing and restoration since he has lived 
there. If you visit this cemetery be sure to see him. He has a firm grasp of the 
issues here and enjoys telling others about the cemetery.<i><br>
