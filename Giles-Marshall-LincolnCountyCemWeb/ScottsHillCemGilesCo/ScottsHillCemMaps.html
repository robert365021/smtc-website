This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Scotts Hill Cemetery.
The nearest major town is Pulaski, Tennessee about 6+ miles northeast, as a crow flies.&nbsp;<br>

Follow that for about 3 miles and turn right on Myrick Branch Rd. Go about 2 
miles on that and it will terminate into Johnson Branch Rd. Turn left there and 
follow that for a mile to the cemetery &amp; church on your left.<br>
