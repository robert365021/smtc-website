<font size="2" color="#800000">I am showing you a variety of maps because there 
are errors in the mapping of these roads to this cemetery. 
It is hard enough to find this cemetery without errors in mapping to deal with. 
This one above (MS Streets 2004) does not show the steep curves in the Hanna Branch Road. 
Actually it does not show the cemetery at all so I plotted it in. The 
Cemetery is within 100 yards of the road but this shows it around 500 yards from 
the road. The cemetery was plotted on the GPS coordinates to find its location 
on this map.<br>

As far as I can tell this Google road map gets as close as I can find to the truth.
Directions: From the Hwy 64 (Pulaski bypass): Go south on Hwy 166 (Bethel Road) 
about 7 miles. Turn right (west) on Hanna Road, and go about 2/3 of a mile and 
turn back left (south) on Hanna Branch Road. Wind up and down the hills and 
around the curves more than a mile and when you are in a steep right hand bend in the road look left at a newly cleared utility 
easement (about 400 yards out) at an old chimney and beyond that to a clearing 
about 500 yards from the road. There is an open field out from you where 
deer hunting is serious business with a deer stand etc. Near the road is a 
locked metal gate. If you use that you will need permission to go on this land. 
If you use the utility easement 40 yards further south up the bend in the road you will be nearer 
the cemetery. So park at the easement and walk in the direction (east) toward the old 
chimney following along under the power lines. Something about 1/2 way to the chimney turn 90 
degrees right (facing south up the gentle slope &amp; woods) and look for the stones 
just inside the forest. The cemetery will be south of you in the forest about 40 yards 
from you in the edge of the woods. Go in the winter time and you can see the stones on 
your eastward walk.</font><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>

</font><font size="2" color="#800000">This map is to tie down this location if 
the roads are changed again. These are improved and graveled field roads 
that as of now are limestone gravel. One thing I could say in the above written 
instructions, if you start to climb up that long winding hill going past the 
cemetery. This hill is so steep now you are subject to spinning out in the 
gravel. In this case you have passed the cemetery location by about 200 yards. You can 
see the steepness of this hill on this map by the thick brown lines climbing up 
to elevation 900 feet. There is a house at the top of this hill where I found a man on 
the way to work who told me how to find this cemetery or I would have never 
found it. With my instructions it can now be found easily enough. <br>
I offer you an alternative route to find this cemetery. Although the road 
names are OK the final instructions lands one at the locked gate and 300 yards from this 
cemetery whereas my instructions will get you within 200 yards from the road, when at the point 
you walk toward the cemetery: From Stella turn right on Gilbert-Curry Road. 
Follow that for more than a 1/2 mile to 
Hanna Branch Rd. turn left on Hanna Branch Rd to Chestnut Grove Community (Black 
Church on left), and go up and down 
hill about 1.2 miles, at the bottom of the steep hill look your right and you will see a 
clearing which follows a utility right of way and power lines. The cemetery 
is on right side of that clearing in the woods up the slope. (N 35N 03.590 -W 87N 03.477 
Elevation 740') translated to digital as: N 35.05980 X W -87.5790 <br>

</font><font size="2" color="#800000">This aerial map shows the cemetery and 
land marks that you can use to find it. It is typically a hard to find 
cemetery, since you look into the woods and the stones are camouflaged inside the 
forest. This is a winter time visit. </font>

utility easement the cemetery is on our right into the woods from this location 
as depicted by the graphics. 
We are looking eastward. The old chimney is visible but slightly hidden by a 
cedar tree out in front of the utility pole.<br>

the woods where the cemetery is located. I have yellow pointers pointing out 
stones that are not so easy to spot from this photo. The stones are the same 
color as the woodland and also we are looking across the flat side of the stones instead of 
directly toward the wide side as they face eastward.<br>
