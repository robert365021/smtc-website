  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Go south from Old Lynnville aka 
		Waco 2 miles to the junction of Apple Hill Road and turn left or east 
		into the field road which becomes the right of way to this cemetery and 
		also serves the farmer access to his tillable crop land. Stop within 10 yards 
		of the Highway and walk down the right of way and climb up left 
		into the steps on into the cemetery. These steps are about a 100 yards from 
		Highway 31. When I was there the land renter had posted a no trespassing 
		sign. I think he is overstepping his bounds, but it is there to prevent 
		hunters and others that trample on his crops &amp; frighten his livestock. We 
		want to do our best to properly interface with this owner no mater how 
		temperamental. Mr. Arnold Williams currently owns this 
		property. I understand he is not very tolerant of out-of-town 
		graveyard visitors. This is a very large cemetery and it has a clear right of way 
		and it would be easy to establish that in court if necessary, but 
		hopefully none of that. You should be willing to sign a release form to 
		visit here. A release form releases the land owners from liability from 
		your accidents. Ugh! I hate that. Take responsibility for yourselves 
		people or cower in your homes. That is my idea of how it should be 
		otherwise Lawyers and landowners will drum us out of all the cemetery 
		visitations. Can you blame the landowners. They don't want to be sued.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery more clearly under a clump of trees. It is 
		actually behind a house and being lightly maintained. There had been a 
		storm there in the spring which blew limbs down and some of the cemetery 
		was blocked by those but not so much to cause brush to grow up 
		uncontrollably. The house in front of the cemetery has a fence bordering 
		the property lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></b><font size="2"><br>
