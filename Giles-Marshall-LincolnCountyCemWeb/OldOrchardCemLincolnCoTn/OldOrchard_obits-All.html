Orange Flowers<br>
At the Cumberland Presbyterian Church at this place, on the 16th inst. Mr. Felix 
M. Bledsoe of Petersburg, was married to Miss Mary Bell Blake, the daughter of 
Mr. and Mrs. Hugh M. Blake, of this place. The ceremony was performed by Rev. W. 
H. Groves assisted by Rev. W. G. Templeton. A large number of the citizens 
filled the church to witness the union of this very popular couple. The bride 
was richly and handsomely attired in a brocaded brown silk dress and a faultless 
bridal hat. We can but join their many friends in wishing that each footstep 
along the path of their wedded life may lead on to prosperity, and that it may 
be their happy lot to drink often and deep of true happiness. After the ceremony 
was over they repaired to the residence of the bride’s father, and partook of an 
elegant lunch, at which our junior was present and played a conspicuous 
part.—they then left for Petersburg.—Fayetteville Express</p>

Virginia (&quot;Ginny&quot;) Rader</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Virginia 
'Ginny' Rader Gillespie (Mrs. Edward D.), age 96, passed from this life to the 
next on Tuesday, September 30, 2014 after sustaining a broken hip in a fall. <br>
Ginny was born in Parkersburg, WV on July 24, 1918, the third of nine children. 
She always remembered her childhood as one filled with fun, companionship and 
love. In this atmosphere, she grew to become a very strong and independent 
woman, putting herself through secretarial school and when WWII broke out, 
joining the Women's Army Corps (WACs). This began what would become a life-long 
love affair with travel. While with the WACs she lived on the Ivory Coast of 
Africa, in London, in Paris and in Japan. While in Japan, she met the handsome 
and charming Lt. Ed Gillespie, who swept her off her feet. Their romance bloomed 
and when Ed was transferred back to the States, Ginny went back as well. They 
were married on September 17, 1949.<br>
Their early family life was spent in the Air Force, where Ed rose to the rank of 
Colonel. Ginny loved military life and was an active in many base activities and 
organizations. Ed retired from the military in 1964 and went to work for Hughes 
Aircraft Company. His career there had the family on the move between California 
and Europe every couple of years, with stays in Belgium, Germany and Greece. 
During this time, Ginny indulged her love of travel and, in addition to family 
trips on the continent and to the Holy Lands, traveled on her own to 
Scandinavia, divided Berlin and communist Russia, among other places. During 
their later stays in Europe, Ginny rejoined the work force, working for the US 
Dept. of Defense in Germany and in Greece. <br>
Upon retirement from Hughes Aircraft in 1979, Ed and Ginny moved back to 
Montgomery, where they bought a home on 10-acres where Ed could garden and raise 
bird dogs and horses. During this time, they traveled extensively in their 
Airstream trailer with the local Airstream club, something that they both 
enjoyed immensely. Ginny became active in several organizations and returned to 
playing bridge, which she dearly loved. She also began working for the Alabama 
legislature when it was in session. She loved being part of the working world 
and continued to work for the legislature until she was 85 years old. <br>
After Ed's death in 2010, Ginny began traveling again – this time with her 
daughter Janet. They went on several adventures in Janet's truck camper but 
mostly they went on cruises. There were still a few parts of the world that 
Ginny hadn't seen but over the next two years she managed to cruise to most of 
them: Nova Scotia, the southern Caribbean, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Egypt, the 
Suez Canal, Dubai, the coast of India, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New 
Zealand. And as much as she enjoyed the traveling, she enjoyed dressing up for 
dinner – always in the formal dining room – and taking part in the onboard 
entertainment even more, often closing out the bar when a good band was playing.<br>
Her last trip was this past summer, when she went to Santa Fe, NM to be near her 
granddaughter Jenny and her first great-grandchild Raphael. While she enjoyed 
the New Mexico weather and the scenery, she truly delighted in spending time 
with Raphael and always asked &quot;Where is that baby boy?&quot; whenever he wasn't 
around. It was a wonderful way to close out her life.<br>
Ginny is survived by her son Edward D. Gillespie, Jr. of Pike Road, AL, her 
daughter Janet D. Gillespie of Austin, TX, her grandson Tristan Gillespie Rhodes 
and his wife Amanda Winkles of San Marcos, TX, her granddaughter Jennifer 
Gillespie Rhodes, her husband Michael Shedler and great-grandson Raphael Rhodes 
Shedler all of New York City, NY, her sister Velda Sangalis and her husband Dean 
Sangalis of Merrilville, IN, her sister Veda Shank of Washington, WV, her 
sister-in-law Marguerite Meadows and her husband Dudley Meadows of Chattanooga, 
TN, her brother-in-law John F. Gillespie of Savannah, GA and numerous nieces and 
nephews.<br>
Funeral arrangements are being made through Gallant Funeral Home, Fayetteville,

Theo Harris died last Friday<br>
Pittsburg (Tenn.) News<br>
On the 14th of April, 1922, Theo. F. Harris, Esq. 78 years old, a prominent 
citizen of Lincoln County, died at his home near Petersburg of pneumonia. While 
his health had been feeble for some time he was sick only a few days before his 
death, therefore it was a surprise and shock to his many friends. He had lived 
all his life in the immediate neighborhood where he was born, in fact owns the 
farm on which he was born. When seventeen years old, he volunteered in the 8th 
Tenn. Regiment, C. S. A. and was a good and brave soldier in active service 
until severely wounded in the shoulder at Rasacea, Georgia, that disabled him 
for further service. While convalescing at his father's home in Montevalle, 
Ala., he met and married Miss Mollie C. Harris in 1864, they have lived happily 
together all their fifty eight years and reared a family, five sons and one 
daughter: three sons, Phillip, Gus, of Columbia, Ms., and Ulver and the 
daughter, Mrs. Frank Fowler, with his wife, survive him. At the time of his 
death he was and had been for about twenty years, Magistrate of the 11th Civil 
District of Lincoln County, and as a member of the County Court, he was ever 
mindful of the best interests of the county. He was President of the 8th 
Tennessee and Consolidated Regiments Confederate Veterans since 1916 and was 
First Vice President of Shackelford and Fulton Bivouac and Camp 114, Confederate 
Veterans. His Funeral was preached at his beautiful country home by his 
lide-long friend, comrade and brother in the church, Elder T. C. Little. He was 
a member of the Christian church for nearly fifty years, and was one of the 
original members of the Friendship congregation near Blakeville. In politics, he 
was a Democrat.<br>
Theo. F. Harris was polite, affable and genteel; a true and devoted husband, a 
kind and patient father; a true friend and good citizen; the county will miss 
him. Peace be to his ashes. The News extends sympathy. </span></p>

Of B.F. Hart (1849-1941)<br>
</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
<br>
To write about self sounds like blowing your own horn, but as requested I will 
try to do so. My parents were Samuel and Emily Motlow Hart. I was born January 
16, 1849, in Marshall County, near Petersburg, Tenn., and have lived all my life 
on a farm in that same community. My father died when I was three years old, 
leaving mother with five children and a debt of seven hundred dollars. Be it 
said to her honor, she reared the children and paid the debt before her death. 
As to my education, I went to school very little. I hated the schoolboy 
declamation part of school, and have not gotten over that yet. I was too stupid 
to realize the value of a school until the Civil War came and broke up the 
school. After the war, there was work to do. I did go to the T. B. Larimore 
School, at Mars Hill, Ala., one term and learned the best lesson of my life. 
That lesson was, if I preached the Book, I must study and learn it for myself. I 
obeyed the gospel at the age of seventeen, knowing but little about the Bible; 
but when those old brethren said, “We take the Bible wholly and solely as the 
man of our counsel,” that appealed to me then and still appeals to me. I 
preached my first sermon in September, 1872, at old Cane Creek. I cannot tell 
how awkward I was nor how many mistakes I made, but the brethren were kind and 
encouraged me to go on. I have had but few additions since. Most of my preaching 
has been to the church and nearly all in my own community. I am glad now this is 
true, since I have lived to see the church grow from three congregations to 
eleven within the radius of ten miles of my home, and I know my people and they 
know me. I have the distinction of baptizing eight old people over eighty years 
of age, one man ninety-three years of age. I have no idea how many funerals I 
have conducted nor how many marriage ceremonies I have performed. I am thankful 
to my Maker that, though nearing ninety-one years, I am still able to drive my 
own car and go and preach. I have been a reader of the <i>Gospel Advocate</i> 
since 1872.–-<i>Gospel Advocate</i>, January 4, 1940, p. 17.</span></p>

LONG is a son of Joseph Long, who was born in North Carolina, and came to 
Tennessee and married Matilda Flack. The mother was born in 1804 and died in 
1873. Our subject received a common school education, and after a marriage, on 
October 22, 1857, in Lincoln County, Tennessee to Tabitha Bledsoe, he tilled the 
home farm for his mother, who was a widow. <br>
- His wife was born near Petersburg, November 10, 1836, and seven children 
blessed her union with Mr. Long: Alva M. (Mrs. J. C. Moore), Nora (Mrs. C. A. 
Talley), Thomas A., Fannie E. (Mrs. O. B. Taylor), James B., Helen B. and Affa 
C. In 1872 our subject and family moved onto their present farm of 200 acres, 
comprising seven acres of all kinds of fruit trees. <br>
- Mr. Long has given his children good educational advantages, is Conservative 
in politics, voting rather for the man than the party. He served in the late war 
in Company F., Forty-first Tennessee Infantry, and took an active part in the 
battles of Fort Donelson, Franklin, Nashville and several minor engagements. He 
was captured at the fall of Fort Donelson, and imprisoned seven months at 
Lafayette and Indianapolis, In. He was the wagonmaster in the quartermaster's 
department two years. He returned home in the fall of 1864. He and wife are 
members of the Methodist Episcopal Church South.&nbsp;</span></p>

MEMORY OF J. E. PROSSER<br>
On July 12, 1934, our brother. J. E. Prosser was called by death, Being almost 
seventy five years old, the church at Petersburg, Tenn., where he worshiped has 
sustained a great loss. He always took an active part in the service always 
occupying the front seat and it will be difficult to get reconciled to his 
absence from this place.<br>
Brother Jimmie was always pleasant and congenial. Be was a man of a great deal 
of energy and vitality. Whatever he did he did it with all his might.<br>
He was a public spirited man and was always interested in any movement for the 
good of the community in which he lived. Had great courage and conviction for 
what he thought to be right. He leaves a wife who helped him fight life's 
battles for more than fifty years; also one son and two daughters; one sister 
and three brothers.<br>
For more than sixty year he and his three brothers have lived close to<br>
each other without one being taken by death, seemingly a long time for<br>
four brothers to be permitted to be together; but when the separation<br>
comes and the remaining ones look back over !heir sojourn it seems unto us but a 
few days for the love we had him. The only solid comfort<br>
I find is to look forward to the any, of reunion in that clime where death and 
sorrow never come. The only fears I have are will I be ready for that great day.

Sarah Alene Archer - January 4, 1988<br>
Elk Valley Times, Wednesday, January 6, 1988, p. 2A, c3<br>
Mrs. Sarah Alene Archer Sullivan, 85, of Petersburg died Monday in Lincoln 
Skilled Care Center after a long illness.<br>
The service was Tuesday at the Petersburg Chapel of Ralston-McCauley Funeral 
Home, with the Rev. Tom Porter officiating. Burial was in Old Orchard Cemetery

A native of Marshall County, she was a daughter of the late Charles and Viola

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #993300">SULLIVAN, (Pvt) 
Berry</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">I was told the 
Sullivans left North Carolina, heading west. And Lincoln Co., TN was as “west” 
as they got. Certain of the family were known to have been in Wilson Co., TN 
prior to their appearance in Lincoln.<br>
Berry is the father of John Henry “Gramp” Sullivan. Other children included 
Robert Beauregard Sullivan, Lucy Ann Dunn, and Martha “Mattie” E. Dunn.<br>
He was a Private in the Civil War, a member of Company A, 41st Regiment, 
Tennessee Infantry, CSA out of Petersburg.<br>
He came home to LCT before the war was over, having left some sort of medical 
area in Mississippi. In LCT, he was compelled to swear his allegiance to the 
U.S. His Civil War pension application is on file.<br>
Berry was a farm laborer and later operated a toll road in the Petersburg area.<br>
Of Berry, there is a LOT of misinformation being shared or, at best, information 
with no substantiation.<br>
It is said he is the son of Cornelius Sullivan, but I’ve yet to see an ounce of 
PROOF.<br>
The Sullivan clan in LCT is doubtless interrelated, but the Cornelius angle 
needs documentation. Indeed, a division of property in the Deed Office in 
Lincoln Co. does NOT list Berry among the surviving children of Cornelius or the 
siblings of Cornelius’ children.<br>
This despite the fact that Berry was, at the time and for decades after, alive 
and well and living in Lincoln Co.<br>
Also, per Cornelius’ will, which left his children heirs, but NOT BY NAME, Berry 
would have been equal in all shares to his purported siblings, unless some prior 
bequest had been made.<br>
Interestingly, Berry and Emeline do NOT show in the 1850 LCT census, though they 
were married there in 1849 and appear in every LCT census afterwards.<br>
In a similar issue, Berry is sometimes referred to as “Berry NEWTON Sullivan,” 
but no documentation supports this. The Newton Sullivan listed as a son of 
Cornelius in the “Goodspeed History of Lincoln County, Tennessee” is another 
person, entirely.<br>
In yet another related issue, Berry is referred to as Benjamin with “Berry” as 
his nickname. That is from a transcription…looking at the original record 
appears that there is a stray mark after “Berry,” rather than a period after 
“Benj.” No other records found, from census to family Bibles, identify him as 
“Benjamin.” Despite that, the name is widely dispersed.<br>
An Emeline does show in the family of a John (or was it Joseph?) Sullivan in the 
1850 LCT Census. It has been said this Emeline was his daughter, but is it 
POSSIBLE that she was his daughter-in-LAW, and was Berry’s wife?<br>
Neither obits nor death certificates have been found for Berry or Emeline, who 
lived their latter years in Petersburg and are said to have died there.<br>
Their tombstones are in that town and my grandmother called him “Grandpa 
Petersburg.”<br>
That seems to settle it.<br>

whereas Emeline is the granny.<br>
Moreover, next to Emeline in this cemetery is Elizabeth Marr Armstrong, John and 
Sarah &quot;Sally&quot;[Bradley] Marr's daughter. The parents were originally from the 
Raleigh, NC area, but the siblings were apparently all born in Middle Tennessee.<br>
