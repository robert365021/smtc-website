Photos dated 22 Sep 2007 shared here and on Chestnut Ridge Cousins by Ann 
Bohannon McDonald using shaving cream to bring out the inscriptions. Added here 2 Apr 2015. Visited originally and Listed Dec 5, 
1979 by Ralph D. Whitesell, &amp; Helen and Tim Marsh in the book Marshall County 
Tennessee Cemeteries Page 254. The Peggy Hogan Petty stone was found after  
their visit but the footstone was visible as it is now. Listed on 
Findagrave.com, but Ann's photos are better. I do not endorse the listing of the 
Children of Peter as I do not know the source.</i></b></p>
