Location: From 
Fayetteville go north many miles on Highway 231 to Chestnut Ridge and turn left 
on Hwy 129 (Chestnut Ridge/Petersburg Rd). Follow that about 3 miles and turn 
right (north) on Bledsoe Road and go something under three miles and turn left 
on Hannah Gap Road. The Hannah Gap Baptist Church is on your right just before 
you turn left. Follow Hannah Gap Road 2 and 8/10 of a mile and look to the right 
at a home and field road going on the left side of the home up a gentle slope.

<font color="#000080" face="Courier New">follow the Farm Road north &amp; up as it 
bares to the right a bit and when you have gone about 1/4 of a mile from the 
road look left at the fence row and tree line. The cemetery is this side of the 
fence row along that fence line on the highest part of the fence line just 
inside a grove of trees.</font><font face="Courier New"><br>
