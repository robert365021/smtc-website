<p>Liz I am a serious graveyard
researcher, much more than just an Austin graveyard researcher. I wanted to give
you the Austin listings in the Austin/Croney/Harwell Cemetery that I have now
confirmed against the tombstones. There were errors in the books and other
evidence that suggest relationships there. I see this all the time in
graveyards, though some relationships may not necessarily be written in the
inscriptions. This is some of my analysis on the Austin portion of this
graveyard. I see the genealogy of James only mentions a daughter but I believe
at least the W. E. Austin to be a son based on the way the graves are laid out
in this cemetery. here is my listing and some analysis. I will add more
information to this as I get closer to publishing this cemetery on the Internet
at the URL I sent you earlier.<br>

<p>I believe the Harlows in this
cemetery are related to the Austins. Some of the graves are in the same rows and
even have some co-mingling of grave proximity. The Harlow's are fairly
old, but I am not including them in this analysis. Chances are good there was
an Austin daughter that married a Harlow. Croneys are much later (unless they
are part of the early unmarked graves) and are interred on the other end of the
cemetery so that lessens the chances of a relationship and may mean they bought
the Austin farm. I am told it was a log structure with 60' length beams. After
dismantling, these were sold to a Nashville Country Music Land Developer, to be
used in a restoration effort.<br>
<br>
I was told by the land owner of the Austin/Croney/Harwell Cemetery the Austins
of the Austin Cemetery of Ardmore Tennessee are related even though that is
partly in Lincoln county. He was only going on here-say so don't know how
reliable that is. That is really only about 3- 4 miles southeast of here also in
Giles County, but across the Elk River. I was referring to this Alexander
Austin, b. 1864 a much later guy. I have seen his photo and he does some favor
my father with the lanky prominent face &amp; jaw line. However that is a common 
trait too.<br>
