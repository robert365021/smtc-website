Go south on Hwy 166 from Pulaski for less than a mile and look west (or right) 
between two houses at the tall white tombstones visible from the road. This is 
across the road from where Cedar Place Drive junctions with Highway 166. <br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery well maintained. Be 
sure you go here with upscale intentions and secure permission. This is between 
two residential homes. A good way to do that is leave a note in the mailbox 
three days before the visit announcing your intentions giving the exact time and 
date.<br>
