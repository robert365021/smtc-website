This photo shows the tumbled mess of the Jacob &amp; Almanza Yokley memorials with
broken and piled up
stones everywhere. This damage is probably caused from cattle rubbing against
the stones as the bases seem level to me and might be otherwise standing. <i>Info and Photo by Wayne Austin 21 Dec 2009.<br>

</i>This rather distant photo looks northeast from the west side of the cemetery.
The old &amp; tall ones that are buried deep into the
ground are still standing though they may lean badly. The newest stones around the
late 1800s or early 1900s are all fallen to the ground because the bases have
not been kept level and/or the cattle knock them over along with trees falling on
them.<br>

This photo looks west at the western part of the cemetery at some of the oldest
Alexander and Abernathy memorials. The stone leaning out from the tree is for
C.C. Ellis. The gate is in the upper center of the photo and standing open.
The hardware that bolts it and keeps it closed is missing.&nbsp;<br>
 Generally the small
stones out in front of the big ones are foot stones to the east of the
headstones.<br>

This photo looks north at many of the Yokley memorials. <i>Photo &amp; info by

This image looks south at the English memorials. We also see the white color
(sun reflecting from it) of the American Revolutionary War Soldier David
Abernathy - military marker in the far right middle of the photo. <i>Photo &amp;
info by Wayne Austin 21 Dec 2009.</i><br>
<img border="0" src="v-1882.JPG" width="745" height="558"><br>
Here looking southwest we see the tombs of several of the Abernathy and English
family memorials. In the bottom right corner we see just a little of the corner
of the American Revolutionary War Soldier David Abernathy military marker.<br>

</i>Panning further west, but still looking southwest we see the tombs of several of
the Abernathy and English family memorials. In the bottom right area we see just
a little of the side of the American Revolutionary War Soldier David Abernathy
military marker. In the distance is the Hedge Trees overshadowing the Vick
Family graves. <i>Info and Photo by Wayne Austin 21 Dec 2009.<br>

</i>Looking east at many of the memorials this wide angle photo shows some of
the Yokley &amp; Alexander memorials. <i>Info and Photo by Wayne Austin 21 Dec 2009.</i><br>
