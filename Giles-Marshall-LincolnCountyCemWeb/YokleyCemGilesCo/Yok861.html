Feb 1836, daughter of Andrew &amp; Delia Morris Yokley.</b><i><b><br>
We can tell by the bits and pieces of stone with words that this memorial
belonged to a Catherine daughter of Andrew &amp; Delia Yokley who died 10 Feb
1836. Also still visible is the birth month of Sept. It is my assumption that
the following stone fragments found scattered on the ground on the south side
next to the stone of Franklin A. Yokley can be matched to the works of an
earlier transcriber who found the above grave stone complete in their time,
whether that be 1983 in the book Giles County Cemeteries or prior to that. This
stone is crumbling apart, and I left the pieces on the foot of the Franklin A.
Yokley memorial. By getting these up off of the damp ground it will dry them out
and harden the fragments somewhat and cause them to last longer.<br>
