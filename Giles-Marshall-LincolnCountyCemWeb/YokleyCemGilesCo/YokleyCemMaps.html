&amp; Smith Hollow Rd) GILES COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br>
  <img border="0" src="YokleyCemRdMap.JPG" width="1015" height="601"><br>
  Location: Highway 64 West, right onto Campbellsville Road (Hwy 166). Go thru
  Campbellsville and turn right on Highway 245 (Columbia Road) toward Columbia.
  Go about 2 miles and the cemetery us on your right on hill behind Angus house,
  in chain link fence. After permission there is a un-maintained road by the
  barn that goes up the hill following a east/west fence row to the cemetery. This cemetery was plotted by Wayne
  Austin using a copy of MS Streets &amp; Trips. It is not actually placed on
  that map. The United States Geological Survey omitted this cemetery from the mapping
  survey.<br>

  From this Aerial view we see the trees on the slope of a hill where the
  cemetery is surrounded by a chain link fence. The Longitude &amp; Latitude of
  this cemetery as calculated using MS Streets &amp; Trips is 35.38064
  degrees North X 87.12390 degrees West with a small degree of error in the
  range of calculation. This cemetery was not found on any map that I am
  familiar with and thus all the above map placements is by Wayne Austin. The
  yellow pointer points out the cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
