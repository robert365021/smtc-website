The Vick Family lots are under the Hedge Shrub Bushes. Here we see the head
&amp; footstones for John H. Vick &amp; his wife Annie Jane Barlar and
headstones for three of their sons Kenneth on the south of their dual headstone
and Johnnie &amp; Charley (our subject here) on our right (north) side of their
parents stone. Several other unmarked fieldstones show graves in line with these
and immediately to the north down the north/south row. All this is in the
southwest corner of the cemetery.<br>
