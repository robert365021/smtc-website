The Poplar Grove Cumberland Presbyterian Church was thought to be located near
this graveyard at one time. This inscription lends weight to that possibility. The
congregation moved to Campbellsville about 2 miles south west of here sometime
after the founding of this graveyard in or prior to the 1830s. The little
quaint church building is still there today standing as a reminder of the deep
faith of these people. See photo on main menu&quot;&nbsp;<br>
