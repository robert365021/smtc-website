The Vick Family lots are under the Hedge Shrub Bushes. Here we see the head
&amp; footstones for John H. Vick &amp; his wife Annie Jane Barlar and
headstones for three of their sons Kenneth on the south of their dual headstone
and Johnnie (our subject here) &amp; Charley on our right (north) side of their
parents stone. Several other unmarked fieldstones show graves in line with these
and immediately to the north down the north/south row. All this is in the
southwest corner of the cemetery.<br>
