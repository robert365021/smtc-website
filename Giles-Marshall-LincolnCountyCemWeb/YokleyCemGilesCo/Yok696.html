Someone has left the carcass of a deceased Cow in this cemetery. The vultures
paid their visit and were roosting on the stones as they fed on the carcass
leaving these stones in a mess and potentially medically harmful to humans. By
the time I visited there in Dec to help Terina with the photography the vultures
had left and this stone was washed clean by rainwater, but much of the carcass
was still there. </b><i><b>Photo by Terina Boyd 10 Oct
