This area photo shows the Yokley
Cemetery in the distance on the hill in a clump of trees. You can also see the
faint outline of the cemetery fencing. The photographer is standing at the intersection
of Smith Hollow Road and Campbellsville Pike or Hwy 245.&nbsp; In view is the
Smith Hollow Road on our right. <i>Info and Photo by Wayne Austin 21 Dec 2009.<br>

This photo was snapped while
approaching the cemetery from the south side and shows the fencing and trees
that line the cemetery. The chain link fence here has been compromised in a
couple of places and the gate is left open or improperly secured so that cattle
are able to go into this cemetery.<i> Photo by

This photo was made from the southeast area of the cemetery shooting west to
west-north. While it captures most of the memorials in this cemetery the stones tend
not to be seen among the brush and trees. There are a few graves behind us, but
the lions share of the 100+ graves are down at the west end of the cemetery. On
our left showing as a black and brown mass is the carcass of a deceased cow.
That should not be there. It has been there long enough for nature to ravage the remains. If this were fresh an individual could not get within 500
yards of this cemetery without gagging. I don't understand anyone tolerating this on their farm.
Farmers should not be disposing of cattle remains in graveyards nor anywhere in
this manner. It is not according to health standards and especially improper
here. Remains should be buried or burned. There was also evidence that cattle
remains had been burned in this graveyard in the past such as spent fires and
scattered cattle bones exist. Lawmakers now you see why we family historians clamor
loudly for more control over our ancestral grounds in the Tennessee Laws. A look
at the condition of this cemetery with the broken and piled up memorials
everywhere is another reason. <i>Info and Photo by Wayne Austin 21 Dec 2009.<br>

</i>This photo was made from the west side of the cemetery shooting eastward and
shows many of the memorials. The oldest &amp; tall ones that are buried deep into the
ground are still standing though they may lean badly. The newest stones around the
late 1800s or early 1900s are all fallen to the ground because the bases have
not been kept level and the cattle knock them over along with trees falling on
them. Of course they also suffer at the hands of vandals.<br>

This photo looks west at the western part of the cemetery at many of the oldest
Alexander and Abernathy memorials. The gate is on our right and standing open.
The hardware that bolts it and keeps it closed is missing.&nbsp;<br>
 Generally the small
stones out in front of the big ones are foot stones to the east of the
headstones.<br>

This photo looking west at the gate into the cemetery shows an unidentified lady
helping Trina Boyd in the photography effort. In this photo she is likely puzzling
over how to get the gate to stay closed given the missing adaptive hardware for that.
We are also looking at the memorial (leaning away from the tree) of C.C. Ellis.<br>

This image presents a closer look at the box tombs of the Alexander family
and the English memorials in the foreground.<br>
<img border="0" src="v1876.JPG" width="833" height="514"><br>
Here looking northeast we see the box tombs of William C. &amp; Franklin A.
Yokley among other mostly Yokley Children, but in the upper right edge are the
two box tombs of Andrew &amp; Delia Yokley. In the distant upper right area of
the photo we also see the modern granite marker for Davie Lee &amp; Samantha P.
Yokley. The stone leaning back against the box tomb of Franklin Yokley belongs
to Isaac Yokley.<br>
