fallen and mostly buried headstone in the Milton Alexander lots. Red arrow
points it out.&nbsp;<br>
<font color="#800000">Look at what a mess these stones are in across this photo. They are falling in
every which direction. Folks this is a typical abandoned graveyard and these
cemeteries desperately need the public interest <u>including laws that give the public
better access to clean this up</u>. As of now you go here and if the land owner has a mind to do
so you could be
thrown in jail for trespassing for just being a loving descendent. This
mess could be fixed and have these stones standing beautifully again, if we
would just make the effort. I think the crises is not in this graveyard but in the
American Spirit or lack of thereof. This is a very large cemetery of more than
150 graves and this cemetery probably has descendents spread across this land
maybe as many as half a million strong who have the blood of these progenitors
coursing their veins.</font></font></b></font><b><font size="2"><font color="#800000"><br>

lying on its side protruding underground with buried inscription.). Now I don't
recall my reasons for not uncovering it, but was probably related to how many
pounds of stone I could dig up and pick up in a given day and still retain energy to
complete the day.<font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
