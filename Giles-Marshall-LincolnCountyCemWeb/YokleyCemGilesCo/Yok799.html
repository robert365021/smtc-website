The Vick Family lots are mostly under the Hedge Shrub trees/Bushes but span back
to the north (our right) which includes graves marked with fieldstones. Here we
will find the graves, head &amp; footstones for John H. Vick &amp; his wife
Annie Jane Barlar and headstones, for three of their sons Kenneth (our subject
here) on the south of their dual but fallen headstone, and also Johnnie &amp; Charley on
our right (north) side of their parents stone. Several other unmarked
fieldstones show graves in line with these and immediately to the north down the
north/south row. All this is in the southwest corner of the cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
