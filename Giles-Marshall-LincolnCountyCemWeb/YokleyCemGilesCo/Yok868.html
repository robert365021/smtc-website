Her parents are interred in the H.C. Campbell Cemetery aka Cambpell-Rittenberry
Cemetery in Campbellsville two miles south of here. Maybe the Wests' moved (or
at least started to using the other cemetery) to
Cambpellsville about the same time as the Poplar Grove Cumberland Presbyterian
Church was moved there? By 1903 J.C. &amp; Delia were burying small children in
that cemetery instead of here.</b><i><b><br>
