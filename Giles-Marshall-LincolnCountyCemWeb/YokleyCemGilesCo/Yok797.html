&amp; Smith Hollow Rd) GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<img border="0" src="1803.JPG" width="657" height="495"><br>
The Vick Family lots are mostly under the Hedge Shrub trees/Bushes but span back
to the north (our right) which includes graves marked with fieldstones. Here we
will find the graves, head &amp; footstones for John H. Vick &amp; his wife
Annie Jane Barlar (both of which is our subject here) and headstones, for three
of their sons Kenneth on the south of their dual headstone, and also Johnnie
&amp; Charley on our right (north) side of their parents stone. Several other
unmarked fieldstones show graves in line with these and immediately to the north
down the north/south row. One other infant grave is marked by two fieldstone
close together&nbsp; 10 feet northeast of the John &amp; Annie Vick Headstone. All this is in the southwest corner of the cemetery.
The parents headstone is fallen.<br>

An area view of the John H. &amp; Annie J. Vick monument. It has fallen on its
back because of the large nearby bush roots rendering the base out-of-balance,
whereby the top slide off of the base and toppled backwards.<br>
