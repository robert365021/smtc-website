from Steve Turnbow 24 Feb 2012: My friend, I believe it is also Extremely 
possible that my great-great-Great Grandfather William Cannon Walker (born 1796 
in TN - died: March 8, 1870 in Limestone Co., AL), along with his wife - my 3rd 
Great Grandmother: Rebecca Ann COFFMAN Walker (born 1797 in TN, died 1861 in 
Limestone Co., AL), are ALSO buried here in the Legg-Coffman Cemetery, Giles 
Co., TN (very possibly two of the many Old stones that have washed down the 
hillside there or perhaps under the fieldstone marked graves)! The reason I say 
this, is due to the fact none of our family has any record of where they were 
ever buried, but we all know they lived for decades in neighboring Limestone 
Co., AL (just south of the Giles Co., Tennessee line), along with many other 
Coffmans and Leggs there in Limestone county. ALSO, for knowing that William 
Cannon Walker's daughter-in-law (my great-great grandmother): Millie Caroline 
Golden Walker is for certain, buried in Legg-Coffman Cemetery. Her husband Lovel 
Walker obviously brought her back there for burial, for the reason of knowing 
his grandparents David Harmon Coffman and Mary Ann Lovell Coffman were already 
buried there in Legg-Coffman Cemetery. Knowing all of these facts, I Strongly 
believe in all likelihood Lovel could have also brought his own parents to be 
buried there in Legg-Coffman (William and Rebecca Coffman Walker), simply 
because he most likely wanted his mother to be buried near her own parents, 
David and Mary Coffman. You can ADD: William and Rebecca Coffman Walker and 
their birth/death dates I have provided here, as most likely buried in the 
Legg-Coffman Cemetery. I would be very grateful if you would. Of course I will 
always try to research further to find if they were ever possibly buried in AL, 
but if and when....I ever find out differently, in the meantime, I would be 
grateful if you would add their names to the Legg-Coffman Cemetery, Giles Co., 
TN. I will also go ahead and make their memorials on Findagrave, and list them 
as buried there, until, or if ever we find out otherwise.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all of your work and help! your friend&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;

Commentary by C. Wayne Austin: I have been to this cemetery and cannot refute 
the above position. There are many fieldstone and possibly other lost tombstones 
that mark graves otherwise lost for many generation. This cemetery is only about 
500 yards from the Limestone County Alabama line and these folks did not see the 
State line as any an obstacle. I do know the fieldstones are scattered about and 
what seems to be the lost tombs are not necessarily close to the Millie Walker 
grave, but that is not a clear reason to disprove these listings.<br>
As mentioned to me by Smitty Townsend who aided me in finding this cemetery he 
made me aware of a cemetery that is about 700 to a 1,000 yards or so south of 
this one into Alabama. I should go back there and get Smitty to describe the 
exact location more specifically, so I can visit this perhaps lost cemetery. I 
can tell you there are no known mapped cemeteries in Limestone County anywhere 
near the place Smitty mentioned. That to me makes it a lost graveyard. Perhaps 
this cemetery has some of your kin.</font></font></b><font color="#000080"><font size="2"><b><br>
T</b></font><b><font size="2">he 1860s &amp; 1870s were terrible times for settlers 
to die. The war was going on and after the war was over it continued for many 
years to be a time of extreme uncertainty. It was not a time to die in the south 
because of the high risk there would not be a headstone placed over the grave.<br>
