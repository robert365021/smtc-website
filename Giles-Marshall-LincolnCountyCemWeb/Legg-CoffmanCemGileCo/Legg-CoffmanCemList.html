<p>A story has circulated that some of the 
grave stones in times past have been removed and used for patio tops etc. This 
is not corroborated by myself nor Annie Hindrix. I can see there are missing 
monuments, but they are not likely to have disappeared by any other than 
natural events of nature. Some stones may still be here 4 inches under the 
topsoil. For about all these old graveyards there are stories of abuse around. 
While some of that is true, mostly, the worst I find is neglect by land owners and the 
families of the interred which then brings mother nature's natural forces in play. 
This has the tendency to break every thing back down into dust. Especially old 
limestone and sand stone monuments. The trees in 
this cemetery have been somewhat controlled in the past so that is helpful.<br>
