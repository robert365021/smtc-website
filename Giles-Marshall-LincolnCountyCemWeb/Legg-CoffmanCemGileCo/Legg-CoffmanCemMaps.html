Location: Go Hwy 11 (Minor Hill Rd) to Minor Hill and turn southeast (left) on 
Salem Road and go nearly to the Alabama State line and turn left (east) on the Earl 
Townsend Road and go until the road bears back north 90 degrees northward 
(left). The cemetery will be on your the right up back the hill behind the  
new home of David &amp; Annie Hendrix. You must have their permission. This is a 
private cemetery behind their house. That just means no deed exist for its 
separation from the Hendrix's land. The Hendrix will show you the informal property lines 
of the cemetery if you wish that. You may see Smitty Townsend also for help in viewing 
this cemetery. The Hendrix, Townsend, Howard, Legg &amp; Coffman and Aldredge/(Eldredge) 
families have lived in 
this little valley/hollow or &quot;hollar&quot;&nbsp; for more than a hundred fifty years. 
Please respect their right to a quiet privacy if you visit here. You will then be welcomed, as I was. Smitty did show up with his sawed off shotgun. 
HA! Not really-just kidding, he was one of the most pleasant &amp; helpful&nbsp;persons I've met in a while and he knew much of the recent history of this 
cemetery.)</font></b></span><font size="2" color="#000080"><b><br>

This topographical map shows the hills and valleys (known as Mud Bottom) better. I have pegged with a 
red check and written in red the location of the cemetery. The Hendrix home is 
new and does not show up on this map. The Smith Howard &amp; Earl Townsend homes are 
shown as black dots next to the road.<br>

This Aerial view shows the cemetery location marked with a red check. As you can 
see it is behind a private home on private land. The cemetery outline ends 
many feet southwest of the house making for a clear separation of lot lines as 
shown to me by Smitty Townsend. That northern graveyard line is also southeast 
of the fence line several feet further up the hill.<br>
