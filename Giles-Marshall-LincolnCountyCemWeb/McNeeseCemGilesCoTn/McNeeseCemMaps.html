</b></font><b><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Location using 
directions I followed: Go 
northeast on Hwy 31 Alt to Blooming Grove Road and turn right. Follow 
that for about a mile and the cemetery is nearly a mile northeast of you upon a high 
hill. Today's directions: Go to Mrs Hill's home and turn left with permission. 
Follow her farm road straight back from the home about a half of a mile. Look to 
your right and there will be a gate before you dead end on the field road. If you dead end 
on the road you will be staring at a large insurmountable chasm on your right. 
So cross thru the gate and the small creeks and climb the tree covered hill on 
your left going northeast. If you directions are right at the top you will come 
out into a large open field and the cemetery is on the other end of the field in 
the northeast corner in the edge of the woodland. </font>

My human interest story of the trip back to find this cemetery:<br>
</font></b></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">
<font size="2">
<span style="color: #800000">I took an alternate route to get 
to this cemetery. I went down the field road going east off of Blooming Grove 
Road.&nbsp;Troy Bass a knowledgeable local man had informed me of this method 
of reaching the cemetery without walking straight up a cliff for a mile. 
Well, that is way it seemed to me as I analyzed maps. So I followed instructions 
and turned into a field road that went beside Mrs. Raymond Hill's home. I was lucky 
because the gate was unlocked and open, but they were 
expecting me. I drove back about 800 yards on the field road and found 
my self peering into the Grand Canyon of Tennessee. Well, it might have well been. A deep chasm was on my right between me and the hill I had targeted 
to climb to gain 
access to the large open field I needed to cross. So I backtracked to a gate 100 
yards back and on the right. It became a walk from there, but only for a mountain man. I&nbsp;crossed over the gate and went across two small creeks and various 
other fence hazards without damaging them and started the 200 yard climb up a 
large hill that was so steep it&nbsp;had me moving&nbsp;up from one tree to another to 
stay in&nbsp;balance. I literally pulled myself up the hill using my hands 
by gripping the trees.&nbsp;Finally at the top while puffing like a choo choo train&nbsp;I came out into a long open&nbsp;field. I knew from mapping the&nbsp;McNeese Cem was on 
the far distant&nbsp;northeast corner of the field. That was another 600 yards away. So I 
began the trek across 
the field. It was covered in poison Ivy so I stepped lightly around that stuff.&nbsp; I did 
not&nbsp; worry about chiggers or snakes because I had gotten there 
early&nbsp;enough that the temps were&nbsp;still below 60 degrees. All toll that 
was&nbsp;nearly a mile trip most of which was walking and climbing. I could have 
visited this cemetery from Powell Chapel road but that was further than a mile and 
more fence hazards and unknown land owners. Anyway the McNeese Cemetery came into view in the corner under a 
giant dead cedar. It had never before been reported in 
photography by the Findagrave crowd. Who could blame them because of the effort 
required. There were two rows of gravestones and two 
stones with lost inscriptions, which were actually more crumbled today. I 
was able to partially transcribe&nbsp;one of them, but the other one was in too 
bad of shape. Oddly the footstones and the headstones were crumbled, but the 
crumbled&nbsp;ones&nbsp;were all memorials for Marks children. I think that was 
the 
lost information</span></font><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">.</span></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
