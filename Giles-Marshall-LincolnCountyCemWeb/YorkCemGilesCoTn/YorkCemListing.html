	<b>YORK, Rhoda T. Tomerlin</b>, wife of John S. York, 16 Feb 1851 - only

	**<b><font size="2">Two possibilities are likely for this. (1) The husband 
	died first and the stone was set with her information except for the death 
	date, as she was still living and she chose to be buried elsewhere. (2) 
	Since she died after him the usual conditions are the children were not as 
	vigorous in getting the details inscribed on the stone as the wife was for 
	the husband, so no one inscribed the death date.</font></b></font></p>
