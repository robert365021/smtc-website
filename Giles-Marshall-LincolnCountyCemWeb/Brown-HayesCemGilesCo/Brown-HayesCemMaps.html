<img border="0" src="Brown-HayesCemRd.jpg" width="1600" height="803"><br>
Take Beech Hill Rd out of Pulaski and wind around and at the junction of Beech 
Hill Rd &amp; Powell Chapel Rd the cemetery is in the corner southwest corner of 
that junction beside a house. There is a reserved gate and right of way just 
south of the entrance to the house. The sign about electric currents are 
just bluffing, but obviously the owner does not want a flood of visitors. <br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery just south of the barn and across the branch 
from the road. The owners have posted keep out signs, but I believe he will respect 
your right to visit here. <br>
