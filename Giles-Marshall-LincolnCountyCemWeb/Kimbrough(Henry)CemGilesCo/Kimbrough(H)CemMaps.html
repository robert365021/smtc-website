This map shows the coordinates of the Henry Kimbrough Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="Kimbrough_Cem-Hwy_166Rd_20.jpg" width="1598" height="781"><br>
Go Bethel Road (Hwy 166 South. Veer left on Crooked Hill Road and go 1 mile and 
2 tenths and with permission turn left into the driveway. You 
will find the owners have clear access but the cemetery is north across the fence on 
and not on their property so to go that way you are treading lightly. <br>
<img border="0" src="KimbroughCemAerial.jpg" width="1575" height="568"><br>
This aerial map shows the cemetery accessible from a residential road 
originating just south of &amp; due west of the cemetery. The road goes to a 
house and passes by on the north side, but can be driven to a gate 
and thru the gate with permission drive around the first thicket and get close 
to the north fence (spanning east/west) where the cemetery is across that fence. Have a 
5' ladder to 
cross the fence so no damage is done. The road to the cemetery 
also doubles as the road to the residence and farm operation so be 
sure you go here with deliberate upscale intention, permission is 
needed.<br>
