  [JONES], Moses Lancast[er], 23 Aug 1812 - 16 O[ct 1853], son of Hezekiah &amp;
  Sanai [Jones.] Married 20 Nov 183_ to Mary E. Williams Bur[ge]. Children: Mary
  Ann (Moore), John Lewis, George W. _ _ _<br>
  <i>Characters enclosed in [ ] denote my best guess as to the missing
  information. I believe the surname to be &quot;Jones&quot; because there is a
  Hezekiah and Sinai Jones in this cemetery at about the right age to be Moses's
  parents. I filled in the 1853 for the death date because there was a listing
  of a missing Jones entry in the Giles County Historical book of a Jones that
  died Oct 1853 and it matched up with the above listing. I matched the
  &quot;Bur&quot; with the only Burge surname in this cemetery. That one is a
  bit shallow so you be the judge and use it at your own discretion in our
  genealogy. Photo by Wayne Austin, 29 Nov 2007, 9:30 AM&nbsp; <br>
