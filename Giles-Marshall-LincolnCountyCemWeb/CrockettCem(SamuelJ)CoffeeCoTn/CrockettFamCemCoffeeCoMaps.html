Coming from Nashville exit on Hillsborn Highway (#41) on exit 114 and go to Old 
Airport Road. Keep that several miles until you come to Pratt Road. Turn right 
(south) 
and follow that about a mile and on your left just past a residence will be the 
cemetery in a grove of trees near the road.<br>

This photo looks at the cemetery showing faintly the iron fence surrounding 
these visible graves. First you must see thru the dense briars which completely 
covers this cemetery. Now I know why the Findagrave crowd has not photographed 
these stones. You will get wounded trying to get photos here, unless the trees 
eventually shade out the blackberry vines this is permanent. Do not burn this 
cemetery. The fire will damage the stones. Not having my brush cutting gear I 
used a large stick to beat down the briars best I could, including mashing them 
down carefully with my foot. (bad idea because the thorns got into my shoe and 
five days later they reared their ugly heads on an early morning walk in Alabama.)&nbsp; This 
thrashing formed a narrow path and allowed me one trip thru the 
briars to secure the photos. Clearing the stones of 
briars for the photos presented an extra hazard. My path was so inconspicuous 
that you cannot see it in this photo.<br>
<br>
A sling blade works fairly well in 
eliminating briars but you will still get some pricks that way. The blade will become entangled and 
pull the briars toward you for some choice ouches.<br>
<br>
Findagrave crowd be aware if 
you steal these photos and add them to findagrave I will come after one with a 
vengeance, because of the briar sticks I endured. I don't have a problem with 
them being there, but just without my name &amp; the photo date, because that is bad 
science.
Well, it is only right that someone will see the need to clear this cemetery for the public 
to visit and repair.<br>
