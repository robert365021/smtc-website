Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski on Mill St./Hwy 166. Continue south passing the 
Airfield then the Rock Crusher on the right. Just after the rock Crusher turn 
right on Donahue Rd and take the first left (south) on what is mapped as Story 
Lane or it seems to continue as Donahue Road. This road immediately bends back 
westward. After about 2/3 a mile the road forks to Garner Hollow Road (left) on 
the south fork, but turn right on the right fork to continue on Donahue Road as 
shown on the above map. After about 2 tenths of a mile there will be a gate &amp; 
concrete cattle gap on your left which (with permission) open that and close it 
behind you and drive over the hill following the field road. Continue to go 
south along the length of the field toward or on the right of a big barn which 
you cannot see at first for the trees. Sometimes the fieldroad becomes faint but 
continue in the same direction. You will see a clump of trees in the distance to 
the right of the barn up the slope. Do not take the road to the barn but follow 
past the road that goes to the barn. Climb the hillock to the crest and the 
Gracy-Pittard Cemetery is there on your left south west of the barn about 200 yards 
from the barn in a 
clump of trees. The Serls Cemetery is just a little further along the field road 
and requires a right turn for another 75 yards. It is under three large 
Hackberry trees.

This aerial map shows the cemeteries under two separate groves of trees. 
There is a house southwest of you, but I believe it is on separately owned land. <br>
