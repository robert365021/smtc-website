Born Sept. 25, 1836, died Jan. 26, 1927, aged 91 years 4 months 1 day a ripe old 
age, having passed the four score years by reason of strength. He professed 
faith in Christ &amp; joined the M. E. Church South early in life &amp; throughout his 
long life he spent the best days of it in the service of his church &amp; his 
Master. A man of modest &amp; unassuming character, but with it all, a strong 
character. His very modesty made him strong &amp; won him many friends. He entered 
the Confederate army early in the War Between the States &amp; served his country 
with honor &amp; fidelity. Like many others after the close of the war he turned his 
attention &amp; talents to the rebuilding of the Southl&amp; he loved so well. He 
married Malissa Gracy &amp; to them was born six children. Five whom survive him, 
three boys &amp; two girls &amp; a number of grandchildren. His wife preceding him to 
the grave a number of years ago. To his children &amp; grandchildren &amp; relatives &amp; 
friends he leaves a rich heritage, a good name, which is rather to be chosen 
then great riches. A kind affectionate husb&amp; &amp; father, a good neighbor &amp; a good 
citizen. In exercising his duties of citizenship, he always aspired to the 
higher ideals of life &amp; the things that had for their object &amp; purpose the 
uplift of his country &amp; humanity. He has passed on, but his life will live on in 
the minds &amp; hearts of his loved ones &amp; friends &amp; in that glorious morning of the 
resurrection we hope to meet him again &amp; renew the ties that have momentarily 
been broken by his passing. A Friend. <br>
