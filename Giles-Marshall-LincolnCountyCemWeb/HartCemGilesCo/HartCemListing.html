		If this were a larger cemetery, which it has been reported it was in the 
		past, it is no longer recognizable as such.<br>
		<br>
		2011 Note: I stopped at this house and asked about 
		the permission to visit and whereabouts of this cemetery. I was taken to 
		the owners front yard flower bed. Only the owner knew the stones were 
		there. The two remaining stones were fallen into the ground and had sank 
		below the surface. I dug them up and stood them against the nearest 
		tree. The lady was pleasant and said she did not mind or at least did 
		not object to this. She also said the stones were like that when she 
		moved onto the property several years ago. I guess cemetery enthusiast 
		should be thankful that the land owner was given a bad situation turned 
		it into a flower garden. <br>
		<br>
		1986 Note: It was reported by a Mr. Garrett that several years ago, a 
		lady, unknown to him, came to the cemetery and removed several 
		tombstones. Where she took them remains a mystery. He does not know 
		where they were taken nor anything of the missing stones. </p>
