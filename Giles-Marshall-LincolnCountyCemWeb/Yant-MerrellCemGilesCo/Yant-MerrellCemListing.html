<p>Several fieldstones exist here that at 
one time marked graves. They are now piled together and co-mingled with the base 
stones of at least one fallen box tomb, causing the whole thing to look like a 
pile of common scattered rocks.</p>
<p><b>From Lisa Oliver</b>: Hello Wayne, I 
was wondering if you have ever heard of a cemetery in Giles County off of Young 
Chapel Road?&nbsp; It is located in the eastern part of the county between 
Frankewing and Bunker Hill. The graves are SE behind a barn. All the stones are 
broken and none are standing. At one time there was at least 
one box grave there, now just a pile of rocks. Not sure how many total graves it 
could be anywhere from 3 to 7. Just a guess. Use GPS of 35.169322 -86.863554 on 
the map to find it. Its under a very old Cedar Tree. [Lisa Oliver 4 Feb 2014] 
</p>
<p><b>From C. Wayne Austin:</b> <br>
It is possible this cemetery being much older was a forerunner of the Young 
Chapel Cemetery 300 yards to the northeast of here and a later church building 
caused this graveyard to be abandoned. An old road right of way called the 
Minitra Road goes right by this cemetery, but it is long since abandoned. [4 Feb
