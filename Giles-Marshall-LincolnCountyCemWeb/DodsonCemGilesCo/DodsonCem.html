<p align="center"><i>Oddly I
discovered on 1 Jul 2009 that the Boyd Cemetery reporting in the book Giles
County, Tennessee Cemeteries by the Historical Society shows some of the same
listings above but with far fewer listings. This is as if someone surveyed the
Boyd Cemetery and found only a few of the stones above. Then someone else who
knew the details of the Dodson Cemetery included the whole cemetery. Maybe
the Dodson part or the part with no stone photos is further up into the thicket
and because of the dense brush I missed it. The stones I found are near the
south edge of the thicket. I should say this cemetery is in one of the densest 
thickets I have seen. It is difficult to gain access to the plot and find any of 
the stones in brush over your head and that belies pushing it aside even in the 
winter time. <br>
<br>
* Confirmed &amp; found in this cemetery in this very dense thicket, 15 Jan 2008 by Wayne
Austin. Added here from that survey 25 Apr 2009. The above stones with photos are all I
could find without clearing the brush from this cemetery. There were some fieldstones
marking graves but those were hard to see.</i><br>
