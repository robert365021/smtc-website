<font color="#000080" size="2"><b>From I-65&nbsp;take Exit 27 &amp; go west for about 8 miles
on Hwy 129 passing thru historic Lynnville Tennessee. The cemetery is on the
right just west of the Lynnville business district. You can't miss it because it is one of the
largest cemeteries in Giles County interring folks from northern Giles &amp;
southern Maury County Tennessee.<i><br>

</i>This aerial view shows the cemetery with 5 access roads spanning north/south
and across the rows. There are actually 7 sections to this cemetery which I have
lettered A - G above. Section D, C &amp; E tends to be the oldest and B &amp; A next. The
other sections were developed in the last 30 years. Section G is right behind
the Lynnville Baptist Church facility. There is also a private residence just
west of Section E and the road to Section F &amp; G also serves that private
residence. As of now 15 May the count of stones remains at about 3,479 inscribed
memorials not counting footstone and grave boundary markers.<br>
