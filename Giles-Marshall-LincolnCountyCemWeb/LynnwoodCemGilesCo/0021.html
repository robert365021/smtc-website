<font size="2"><u>BARLAR, Annie The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 29 Dec 1937<br/>
</u>Mrs. Annie Barlar, wife of Bernie Barlar, died at her home near Lynnville 
Friday, December 24th and was buried Christmas Day in the Lynnwood Cemetery, 
funeral services being conducted by Rev. Knox.<br/>
Mrs. Barlar was 51 years of age. All physical aid and close, kind, attention 
could give nothing more than temporary relief. She knew everything until the 
last. She had been a Christian since the age of 16. She was true in all the 
relations of life, as wife, mother, sister, friend, and neighbor. The way in she 
was loved by her children and sister and the interest in, and fondness for them, 
displayed her guileless candor, her transparent honesty, and her gentle nature. 
She will be sadly missed in the neighborhood where she lived but especially in 
the sacred precincts of her home, where her devoted children sit beneath a dark 
shadow longing for the touch of a vanished hand and a voice that is now still. 
May the God of all comfort give consolation from his Holy word.<br/>
Legacy is far better than riches. She leaves a husband, five children, Lucile 
Callahan of Pulaski, Cordell, Brown, Mackie and Melba Barlar, all of Lynnville; 
one sister, Mrs. Sarah Yarbrough of Pulaski, and one brother, Dan Ingrum, of 
Holland, Mo., to mourn her loss, to each of whom sympathy is extended.<br/>
