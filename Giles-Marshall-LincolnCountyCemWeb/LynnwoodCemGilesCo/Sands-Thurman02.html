</font><font size="2"><font color="#000080">SANDS, Thurman E., 7 Oct 1924 - 4 
Jan 1945. &quot;2nd Lt., killed in England&quot; (Ladies Auxiliary VFW marker) section E<br>
</font>His forename was possibly spelled Thurmann. He was in a flight of 479th 
Mustangs out of Wattisham on navigation exercises involving low-level flying. 
His machine was an old P-51b, Serial Number 43-6393 which was retired from 
combat duties and used by newly-arrived US fliers. <br>
At 11.15 am the fighter planes descended from 2,500 feet for a low-level run 
towards the Suffolk coast. His plane was so low it went below the telegraph 
wires and clipped the locomotive hauling the train from Ipswich to Bury St 
Edmunds. It then crashed causing a fire to scatter across three fields.<br>
42 years later, near the back plate of the aircraft's machine gun, were found 
English coins dated 1944-these, together with pieces of the plane, are on 
display in the East Essex Aviation Museum together with a fine photograph of him 
in uniform.<br>
