<b>Looking northwest this 1994 Springtime scanned
photo captures the beauty &amp; colors of the cemetery realistically with a
Canon AE1 film camera. Here we see a very large cemetery occupied by folks as
far away as about 15 miles. That may be partly because the cemetery is well
organized with adequate spacing between graves and nice even rows. </b>
<b>Since then this cemetery has undergone a
significant expansion.<br>

the 1994 photo above. Winter of 2003 photo.&nbsp;<br>
