Delia's daughter who was adopted out after Delia death was originally named 
Florence, but her name was changed to Patricia 'Patty' Brae Hewgley. She was 9 
years old at that time and I think that it was cruel to change her name. I guess 
it was good that they left her surname as a middle name, even though they 
spelled it differently as &quot;Brae&quot;. I know where Patty is buried and plan to make 
a memorial for her and will link to the birth parents, with a note in the 
biography about the adopted parents. After her father died (adopted) Patty's 
mother remarried, I haven't been able to find out the adoptive mother's surname 
after that. Patty (dau. of Delia) and her mother and step father moved to 
Wisconsin.<br>
