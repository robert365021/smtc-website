BRAY, Delia Barlar, 14 Jul 1893 - 15 Dec 1965. (</b></font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>d/o 
John S. Barlow/(Barlar) &amp; Josie Catheline Brickeen; </b></font>

Delia's daughter who was adopted out after Delia death was originally named 
Florence, but her name was changed to Patricia 'Patty' Brae Hewgley. She was 9 
years old at that time and I think that it was cruel to change her name. I guess 
it was good that they left her surname as a middle name, even though they 
spelled it differently as "Brae". I know where Patty is buried and plan to make 
a memorial for her and will link to the birth parents, with a note in the 
biography about the adopted parents. After her father died (adopted) Patty's 
mother remarried, I haven't been able to find out the adoptive mother's surname 
after that. Patty (dau. of Delia) and her mother and step father moved to 
Wisconsin.<br/>
