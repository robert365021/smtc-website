Jerry informed us that Gwendolyn managed the burial (Birdie's) in Lynnwood and 
that she confirmed before her death that Birdie was buried in same grave. Birdie 
divorced Percy Waite in Dade FL in Jul 1958 so her death would have been after 
that date. [Larry Joe Barlar Apr 2012]<br>
The remaining question becomes: Is Birdie in her child's grave location in 
Lynnville, as stated by Jerry - being told by Gwendolyn? And is there any 
evidence of Gwendolyn being buried in Lynnville? [Larry Joe Barlar Apr 2012]<br>
According to Jerry Joe Goforth, Birdie was cremated and buried at front of the 
child's grave in Lynnville. He thought there was supposed to be a small marker 
with that burial...but how would he know, he wasn't there. BUT, he thinks 
Gwendolyn is buried in the grave next to Birdie and the child. Do we know if 
that is fact? [Larry Joe Barlar Apr 2012]<br>
