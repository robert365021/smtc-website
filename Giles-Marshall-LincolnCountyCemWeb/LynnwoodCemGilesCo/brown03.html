<b><font color="#000080" size="2">BROWN, W. H., 31 Jul 1873 - 18 Aug 1918. 
"Father" (mar. to Alice K. Morrow)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
W. H. Brown was born on July 31, 1873; was married on December 2, 1891, to Miss 
Emily Alice Kimbrough; obeyed the gospel in 1901, being baptized by Brother M. 
H. Northcross, and died on August 18, 1918, aged forty-five years and eighteen 
days. On the morning of August 18 Brother Coffman, of Lawrenceburg, Tenn., began 
a meeting with the congregation worshiping at Big Creek, in Giles County, Tenn. 
At the conclusion of the morning services Brother Brown, who was one of the 
elders, a man in robust health and the very prime of his activities, arose and 
began speaking to the congregation with regard to their having fellowship with 
other congregations of the county in sending and supporting a preacher to work 
among the boys in one of the military camps of our country. A heavy rain was 
falling at the time, and while he was speaking a bolt of lightning struck the 
building and seemingly descended a metal rod suspended from the ceiling and 
struck Brother Brown, killing him instantly. Thus he fell at the post of duty, 
surrounded by his family and friends who loved him so well and had the utmost 
confidence in him. The scene in the church building at that time cannot be 
described by eyewitnesses. Parts of the interior of the building were torn off 
and scattered over the terror-stricken audience. Several persons were more or 
less shocked and Brother Brown killed outright. The writer was called to attend 
the funeral, but was in a meeting in Alabama at that time and could not go. 
Brother Coffman conducted the funeral in the presence of a very large throng of 
sorrowing relatives and friends, after which he was buried in Lynnwood Cemetery 
at Lynnville. An aged father and mother, a faithful wife, two sons and four 
grandchildren are left to mourn their loss. May the Lord comfort them. --- J. T. 
Clark. Gospel Advocate, October 17, 1918, page 1000.<br/>
