Webster/Reynolds was the wife of William D. Reynolds &amp; dau.-in-law of Olevia. section D<br>
</font><b><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
</font><tt><font face="Courier New" size="4">I (Robert)found Alice Gertrude 
WEBSTER-REYNOLDS' husband, William D., in<br>
a cemetery in Riverside County, CA, the Mountain View Cemetery, aka,<br>
Beaumont Cemetery in Beaumont, CA.&nbsp; He and some of his daughters and their<br>
spouses are buried there.&nbsp; He died July 18 1955.<br>
<br>
William D. was one of the 22 family claimants who went to Muskogee, I.T.<br>
and filed for benefits from the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes. <br>
He was 27 at the time, stating that both his parents, Thomas C. and<br>
Olevia, had died, she four years earlier (testimony given January 2,<br>
1902).&nbsp; He was married to Alice and had a twenty month old daughter Lillie<br>
Mai.&nbsp; He provided a &quot;paper&quot; from Dan L. Eslick, Clerk of the County Court<br>
of Giles County, TN to the effect that on the 8th day of August, 1899, a<br>
marriage license was issued to W. D. Reynolds and Alice G. Webster and<br>
said were married on that date by Robert S. Brown, Minister of the Gospel.<br>
&nbsp;When question further as to how many years his parents lived together as<br>
man and wife, he replied twenty odd years and how many children his<br>
parents raised, he replied seven.<br>
<br>
I found this interesting because we had documented five children, his<br>
parents were married before the 1860 census and had a 4 year old son (he<br>
also testified at this hearing), at time of 1860 Census, and that Thomas<br>
C. had died in 1889 and Olevia had died in 1898.&nbsp; Son Thomas T. had died<br>
in 1899 and that would leave two other children to account for.&nbsp; 2nd birth<br>
occurred in Feb. 1862 and next in 1870 and then 1872 and then 1878.&nbsp; Now<br>
to figure which gap to look for &quot;missing Children&quot;, ignoring Civil War period.<br>
