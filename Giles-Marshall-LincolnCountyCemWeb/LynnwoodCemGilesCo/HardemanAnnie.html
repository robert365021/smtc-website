  If you look around on this site to see who has prominent memorials and think 
  the more prominent the memorial the more important a person must have been 
  while living on earth. Think again. Annie's life is a prime example of a 
  prominent person with a simple memorial. There were literally thousands of 
  students &amp; young people that were positively impacted through out this country 
  by this lady in her lifetime. [WA 12 Oct 2009]<br>
