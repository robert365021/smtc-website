I put William W. Warren's Civil War pension on the Giles web site here:<br>

<p><b>In his pension material was a letter from William Bee
brother of Warren's first wife and it told she was buried in Mt. Carmel. I found
the pension at the National Archives in Washington D. C. Since I'm not a Warren
descendant I gave all the material to a friend in Moulton, AL who is a
descendant of John Warren.<br>
<br>
When Linda Dean and I copied Mt. Carmel we didn't find Betty's inscribed
tombstone, so it's either gone or there never was one. This is what we have in
our records for Mt Carmel on the Warren surname:&nbsp;<br>
