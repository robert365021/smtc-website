GILL, William Henry The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 11 Oct 1933<br>
W. H. Gill, 86, one of the oldest residents of the Lynnville section, died at 
his home there at an early hour Sunday morning, following an illness of only a 
few days duration. Mr. Gill was a great student of the Bible, so had a wonderful 
store of Biblical knowledge.<br>
Funeral services were conducted Monday at the grave by G. N. Knox, a life-long 
friend of the family. He had been a member of the Church of Christ for about 65 
years.<br>
He is survived by two daughters, Miss Mamie Gill and Mrs. John English of 
Lynnville and three sons, Clifford Gill, Albert Gill of Florence, Ala., and 
Hubert Gill of Jersey City. <br>
