BARLAR, Claxton, 9 Nov 1914 - 22 Jan 1963. 'Son of Lela M. &amp; T.J.
Barlar&quot;, (Lela M Coffee and Thomas Jefferson Barlar), Tenn Cpl 2113 Base
Unit, AAF, WWII,(Stationed at Maxwell AFB, Montgomery, Al., served as a Military
Policeman, injured while handling a prisoner.)&nbsp;<br>
<i>He received head injuries from that service. He recovered, but never lived a
sustainable life sinking into the darkness of mental illness and eventually in
and out of hospitalization for most of the remainder of his 49 years.) As a
small lad I only remember him as a kind soul who loved to show &amp; tell his
many nephews &amp; nieces what a wonderful world of nature, science &amp;
electronics we have all around us, to be studied &amp; revealed. His world
consisted of collecting antique cars, building &amp; collecting radios &amp;
clocks, and other machinery. He was buried on a snowy 22 January 1963. The roads
were so bad the funeral caravan had difficulty traveling the twelve miles south
from Columbia at the Oaks &amp; Nichols Funeral home on the Pulaski Highway to this place. [WA
