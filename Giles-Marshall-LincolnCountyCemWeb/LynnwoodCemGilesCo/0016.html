<p><b>Subject: Uncle Gardner Hubbell's life</b></p>
<p><b>This letter is for the benefit of those of
you who were not able to attend the paying of last respects to Uncle Gardner
Hubbell.</b></p>
<p><b>Uncle Gardner passed away in his sleep the
night of 12-27-1997 or the morning of 12-28. It is uncertain when he passed. He
went to meet his maker so peacefully that he did not awaken anyone during the
night. He went to bed at 11:00 PM and was having trouble sleeping. That was the
last thing he related to Aunt Mary.</b></p>
<p><b>I wish to repeat some of the things
mentioned about Uncle Gardner in the last few days and hours by myself, his
friends &amp; relatives.</b></p>
<p><b>1. He was a very unique person who cared
much for all his family and community.</b></p>
<p><b>2. He &amp; Aunt Mary owned and operated a
400 acre Dairy farm very successfully for the duration of his work life known as 
a Grade A. Dairy Operation.</b></p>
<p><b>3. He stole a bright young local Monsanto
Chemical Company Secretary (Mary Austin) from her job and made her his wife.
Part of the marriage agreement was for her to leave the company and join her
husband on the dairy farm which she did.</b></p>
<p><b>4. As a young man he was a football star at
Campbellsville High having been offered at one time a try out at Auburn
University.</b></p>
<p><b>5. He was a county politician who has
served many years in Giles County government who had actually never lost a
political race. Served as Justice of the Peace much of his adult years.</b></p>
<p><b>6. As Justice of the Peace he had performed
the marriages of many couples. Pete Austin said that his Dad, Homer Austin,
informed him once, that as soon as Uncle Gardner realized he would be performing
marriage ceremonies, he placed a telephone call to Uncle Homer Austin (A trained
minister) to get his advice on how to handle that. But, &quot;didn't matter
anyway cause he was not going to make a ritual out of it&quot;. Couples came to
his home all times and even during the night to tie the bond. He always 
performed the ceremony with every bit the informality and mannerism that was so 
characteristic of his humorous nature and influence.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>7. He sprinkled life with a unique &amp;
simple humor that today lives on several generations later. The enduring twinkle
in his eyes and his ability to laugh at the simpler things of life made for a
charm that caused all people to laugh with him. Thus he was very popular in the
community.</b></p>
<p><b>The passing of Uncle Gardner leaves only
Aunt Mary from that generation on Dad's side of the family. He will be missed as
we also miss others of that generation who had such a looming influence on our
lives. That was 11 Uncles and Aunts and I for one am missing all of these
wonderful people. Such is the traditionally stable &amp; influential life they all lived.</b></p>
<p><b>Your Brother and Uncle.</b></p>
