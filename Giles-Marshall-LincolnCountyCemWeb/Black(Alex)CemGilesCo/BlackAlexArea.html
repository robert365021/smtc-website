<p align="center"><b>BLACK (Alexander) CEMETERY,
PULASKI, GILES COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br>
<img border="0" src="IMG_8002.JPG" width="624" height="467"><br>
Left to Right: First is the stone on the left mostly off of the edge of the
photo for Tabitha Black. Next the tall stone of Alexander Black and out in front
of Alex Black is his small footstone. Next is the stone for Catharine
Westmoreland</b><b> and further right or
behind that is Catharine's footstone with the same kind of top as hers, but not
very visible in the dark foliage. Further out on the left between Alex &amp;
Tabitha but obscured by foliage &amp; trees is the stones of Leroy P &amp; Leroy
M. Black. To the right of the tall stone and also not discernible here because
of trees and distance is the stones of the Peden Children. The other stones are
on the left out of area of the photo. It is interesting that I ask the lady who
lived 80 yards to the east of this graveyard if she knew where this graveyard
was located. She explained where many things were around the area but did not
know of this graveyard in spite of her saying she had lived there 18 years. That
shows us just what uninhabitable thickets these places are after they are
abandoned. The older the graveyard the worse it becomes.<br>

</b><b>Panning the camera left
and detailing left to right we find (out of the range of focus, but top left
arrow) the broken stone of Emily T. Black, to the right of that coming this way
behind the tree is the stone of Mary Black and next Leroy P. Black &amp; Leroy
M. Black and then in the forefront is the stone of Tabitha Black (lower left
arrow) and Alex Black. Last we see the Alex Black footstone on the right edge of
the photo.<br>
<img border="0" src="IMG_7989.JPG" width="750" height="430"><br>
Stone of Mary Black behind the small tree and the stone of Emily T. Black on the
ground in the middle right area of the photo. These stones often fall
and sink into the ground over time and become lost. The purpose of these photos is to help future
visitors locate these stones if they fall.<br>

</b><b>This photo was made from inside the
eastern area of the cemetery. Bordering the east of this graveyard is a fence
and beyond that is an open field.<br>

Among the dense brush here is a home that has (if one can look past the decline)
substantial features, as if it goes back into the 1800s. Not much doubt that
this home was a part of the Alex or Robert Black family who both at one time lived
nearby. Judging from the style of the red siding I believe this home was lived in
up until the 1950s. Old houses in the south are most always
accompanied by a graveyard on the side of the highest hill on the back side of
the property. In the old days they buried their dead on the same property they
lived. This house is located about 150 yards to the west of the Alex Black
graveyard, but has long since been abandoned.</b><b><br>
