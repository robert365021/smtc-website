<i><b>The head stone is broken in the ground and the dates cannot
now be read. The name 'Drucilla' is hard to decipher on the stone. [Jean Costby
2002]/This stone was not found. A large cedar tree had fallen into its space and
evidently covered it. The photo of the footstone says S.E.P. [WA 2009]&nbsp;</b></i><i><b><br>
