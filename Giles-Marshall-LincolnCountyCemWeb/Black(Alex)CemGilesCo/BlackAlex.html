<p align="center"><b>Origination of the
surname "Black": The old surname Black is a Scottish/English name
given at a time when people were named for their trades, back in Scotland and/or
England. These people were Black-Smiths, tradesman plying their skills,
forging tools and instruments using iron and other metals. It was a matter of
heating raw metal to a state whereby it was soft enough to pound with hammers
into the desired shape. <br/>
Down through the ages when all the tradesman naming died out they dropped the
Smith and became Black while others dropped the Black and became Smith. <br/>
</b><b><br/>
The following is from the (old)
writings of Flournoy Rivers<br/>
(published in the book Giles County Tennessee Cemeteries, by the historical
society abt 1990.)</b></p>

<p>"<b>Squire
Black was for many years a prominent citizen and occupied responsible positions.
He was a guiding spirit in the old Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions. His
settlement was just in the valley beyond the second ridge west of Pulaski, the
ridge back of Miss Mary McKissack's place, on what was then one of the main
county roads that runs to (in the old deeds as) the 'Campbellsville road'. Up
the first small hollow that runs to the northeast, Robert Black, a brother of
Squire Alex Black, settled. He predeceased his brother. Was there not another
brother, Nathaniel? The Black graveyard is about 200 or 250 yards east."</b></p>
<p><b>D. H. (or B.H) Peden was the post-bellum
Sheriff, father of Alex and Thomas Peden, Mr. Oakes etc. who at one time lived
at the Robert Black settlement. His wife's maiden name was Drucilla Shadden and
her mother was a Miss Dotson, sister of Squire Black's wife.<br/>
<br/>
Leroy P. Black married Louisa Ann Yancey, of Holly Springs, Miss. Her mother was
Louisa Ann Flournoy, a sister of my (Flourney Rivers) grandfather, William C. F.
a daughter of Silas F. This Louisa Ann Flournoy married Tryon Milton Yancey, who
graduated from the University of North Carolina in the class of 1814; was a
lawyer in Pulaski, removed to Holly Springs, Miss. in the late 1830s. The family
has long since disappeared from Holly Springs. Tryon M.. Jr. was Sheriff of
Tolurane County, California in 1894 or 1895.<br/>
<br/>
Squire Alexander Black's name exists here in the third generation Alex. III, son
of Alex II. Squire Black's son, Dr. William B. Black lives at Van Buren or Fort
Smith, Ark. The late Mrs. Alfred White was also his daughter, and there were
others I do not know about.</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><u>Commentary from Cemetery surveyor at time
of Giles Co Cemetery book</u></b></p>
<p><b>Except the few visible stones above there is nothing to mark the existence
of any other graves in the Black graveyard. The fieldstones are all level with the ground.
Consequently there may be other graves in the enclosure not now distinguishable.
The only other unmarked grave that can
be distinguished is that of a child, with rough undressed rocks picked up from
the hillside for head and foot stones. I am
told there are several Dodson graves in the Alexander Black graveyard, not now
discernible. "Squire Black's father-in-law and mother-in-law, possibly
others.<br/>
