Go out Hwy 64 west toward Pulaski and turn left on Old Elkton Pike. Follow that 
thru Dellrose and when the road dips down to the furtherest southern position 
look left down a slope for a farm road running beside a shed with tractor 
implements &amp; equipment. With Permission to get thru the gate follow that farm 
road south about a 1/4 mile along side a spring branch and there will be a 
upland stand of woods on your right. Continue to follow the farm road until the 
trees on your right ends and then abandon your vehicle and walk due west 
crossing the creek and up the fairly steep climb to the top of the hill. The 
cemetery is in the woods about 200 feet from the south end of the trees and the 
trees also span about 100 feet east &amp; west on either side of the cemetery, but 
on the side you came from is a steep bank you just climbed.<br>
