This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Maddox-Jordan Cemetery. The Cemetery 
is found at GPS N 35.03474 X W -86.85023. 
However, I do not believe this is a correct plotting though this focal point will not be 
hundreds of yards in error.<br>

From Ardmore go (north) out Ardmore Ridge Rd to Lewter Hollow Rd and turn right. 
Go about 1/4 mile and the cemetery is in the northeast corner (but not down next 
to the road) of the junction of 
Lofton Hall Rd and Lewter Hollow Rd on the property of Mr. Edge. Later I went 
back and found it. <br>
&nbsp;Directions in 1985: Highway 31S to Elkton. Off Ardmore Ridge Road, between 
Sinking Creek and railroad on old Currin place, back of house. Map shows 
plotting in front of current house because the house that was there is fallen 
and in a heap of rubble under brush.<br>
