  Minor Hill 2 Mi.), GILES COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br/>

  Go South on Hwy 11 to Minor Hill and turn southeast (left) into Salem Road.
  After 1/4 mile turn left (or east) on Tackett's Branch Rd./or it maybe Whites
  Lane. After 1/2 mile turn right on the West Prong of Shoals Creek Road. Follow
  that for 3/4 mile and turn right into Jackson  Cemetery Rd marked
  incorrectly as W. Shoals Creek Rd on below aerial view. Follow that past a
  historic home on the right and to the cemetery also on the right but upon the
  crest of a knoll. It is inside a fence and well maintained today.<br/>

	This image shows the Jackson Cemetery. I have graphically outlined the 
	borders in white. As you can see the stones are all in the eastern part of 
	the cemetery with the oldest further east. This is a well organized cemetery 
	which can easily be expanded westward. The label on the road W. Shoals Creek 
	Road is incorrect. This is actually the Jackson Cemetery Road. There are 
	private homes and farms using this road. Please respect the neighbors assets 
	&amp; privacy when visiting this cemetery.<br/>
