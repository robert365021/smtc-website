  Obituary</b><br>
  <br>
  It is with sadness that I report the death of Mrs. Nora Jackson {nee} Nora 
  Boyd. She<br>
  died March 1, age 22 years. After lingering three weeks with that dreadful 
  disease, typhoid fever. All that physicians, kind husband and loving sister 
  could do was of no avail. She told them that she would die when she was first 
  taken sick. That she would soon be in heaven with her sweet little babe that 
  proceeded her to the grave four weeks. I visited her during her sickness, and 
  she called her husband to her bedside, and told him that he disliked to die, 
  but was not afraid. Then repeated, �Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall 
  be called the children of God. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall 
  see God.� God bless and help the dear husband, father, mother and sister to 
  realize that time alone can bring the balm to heal such wounds. May they look 
  to Jesus for sustaining power in their grief and be able to say, �Thy will be 
  done.� It was so hard for them to realize that she must be taken from them. 
  But your loved one was called to fill the place for which her pure soul was 
  fitted. She was a member of the Christian Church until death with its icy 
  hands called her to the spirit land. Funeral services were conducted by Rev. 
  J. W. Oakley and she was laid to rest in the Jackson Graveyard.<br>
