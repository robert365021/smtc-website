MARKS, G. (George) M. (Milton), 22 Sep 1840 - 31 May 1921. Father. Gone to a 
bright home where grief cannot enter. (s/o William D. &amp; Jane Marks; h/o Sarah 
Elizabeth Marks.)<br/>
<br/>
<u>MARKS, George Milton The Pulaski Citizen 09 Jun 1921<br/>
</u>George Milton Marks was born September 22, 1840; died May 31, 1921. He was 
twice married, first to Miss Elizabeth Barber in 1864. Of this union there are 
six children living, four sons and two daughters, Walter of Pulaski, Odie of 
Prospect, George W. and Charlie, and Mrs. George Neal and Mrs D. N. Scott.<br/>
He had been a member of the Methodist Church for thirty years and know ye that a 
Prince and a great man is fallen in Israel. He was a true man, of the old type 
and if all men were of his type there would be only one law and that would be a 
law of love. If he had an enemy, it was not known.<br/>
Mr. Marks had not moved his hands for several hours before the end came. But as 
he drew his last breath he folded his hands across his breast and passed into 
the spirit land. He was a good man and full of years. He was the last of the old 
set of Marks, and another one of the heroes of the sixties to pass away.<br/>
Some of his comrades of the long ago were there to witness his last resting 
place.<br/>
He is survived by his second wife, who was Miss Emily Keel. Services at the 
grave were conducted by Rev. W. S. Stroud, burial at the family grave yard.<br/>
But now he is dead wherefore should we fast. Can we bring him back again? We 
shall go to him but he shall not return to us. <br/>
