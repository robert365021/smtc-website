<u>The Pulaski Citizen - 18 May 
1876 - Aspen Hill</u></p>
</b></i>
<p ALIGN="center"><b>There is a man in this community whose history 
is very remarkable. I refer to Mitchell Hazelwood, Esq. He was born in Charlotte 
County, Virginia, on the 8</b></font><b>th
</b><b><font size="2">day of June, 1791; came 
to Giles County in 1818, and except for 9 years in Alabama, has resided here ever 
since. He was married to Miss Maggie Strong, by whom he had 9 children, 6 of 
whom are still living. He now has 6 children, 23 grandchildren, and 33 
great-grandchildren�a family of 62 persons. <br>
This seems like obedience to the divine command, �Be fruitful and multiply.� Mr. 
Hazelwood is now in his 85</b></font><b>th
</b><b><font size="2">year, but is remarkably 
sprightly for a man of his age. He never had a law suit in his life. He was a 
soldier in the War of 1812.</b></p>

illness. He quietly passed away at the advanced age of 86 years, less 27 days. 
He was a soldier in the War of 1812.</b></p>
