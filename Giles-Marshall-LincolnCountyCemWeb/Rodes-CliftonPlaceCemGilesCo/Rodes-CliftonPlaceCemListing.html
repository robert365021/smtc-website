<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -67.5pt"><b>Tyree Rodes 
employed 46 slaves as shown in the 1820 census and his family was 6 members. He 
married Cynthia Holland when he was nearly 40 years old or during 1811. Was 
there an earlier marriage? I am told Tyree Rodes built the Clifton Place home. 
The brick were probably fired from local clays<br>
The most 
recent owner/occupants of the Clifton Place Farm is the Owens Family. They have 
chosen to repair this cemetery and expand the plots for their family use. It is 
then known as the Owens-Clifton Place Cemetery. In the future Mr. Owens informed me 
it is to be renamed the Owens Cemetery.<br>
Due to privacy rights by request of Mr. Owens I am unable to display the Owens 
Cemetery on this site. His wife and Mother-in-law are buried there and he deserves our respect 
for his wishes.</b></p>
