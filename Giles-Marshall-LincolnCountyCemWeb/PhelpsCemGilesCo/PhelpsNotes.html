John's last will was written 19 Dec 1872 (Giles county Courthouse) he stated 
that he was to be buried in Phelps cemetery. We got the birth/death dates from 
an uncle that did research before he died, so not sure if they are correct</font></b></font></p>

<font color="#000080">Not anymore, my sister enclosed around the old part of the 
cemetery with barbwire fence from tree to tree, so that the cows can't get in. 
We are not well off so that's all we could do. My g-g grandfather is also in the 
cemetery he died in 1873 and in his will he stated that he was to be buried 
there, but we have never found the headstone.</font></b></font></p>

CC: Old tradition says my ggrandmother is also buried there outside the fence 
under one of those field rocks. She and her husband were young and poor when she 
died, so I presume she got no headstone. A headstone was later added to the 
Gibsonville Cemetery as a cenotaph. Thanks for clearing it off, but aren't cows 
allowed to go thru the outside area? </font>

My name is Rhonda Phelps Miller, I am the daughter of Mark Phelps. I read the 
article that you wrote about the the cemetery. The two old ladies you mentioned, 
are my aunt's. All of them lived just before you get to the road they were 
sitting within. My dad still lives there and the cabin that my grandfather built 
still sets on the hill. That is where they stay whenever they come to visit. The 
old graveyard is fenced in with wire now, just to keep the cows out and it's 
been cleaned up. My sister did all the work. She and I never felt right about 
it, we were always told they were slave graves, but didn't matter, it needed to 
be kept up. If you are ever in the area again we would be more than glad to meet 
&amp; talk 
with you. Rhonda Miller <br>
