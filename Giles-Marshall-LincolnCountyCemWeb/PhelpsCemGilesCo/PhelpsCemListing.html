</b><u>My first introduction to 
Phelp Cemetery</u></p>
<p align="left">I was introduced to this cemetery 
in 1989 by two older cousins Hilliard &amp; Isaac Leonard Jr. Barlar who were 
themselves 1st cousins, both deceased now. I was shown the fenced area and the 
fieldstone marked grave area of the cemetery where only one very old stone is 
formally inscribed. They told about my/their ancestor Alfred J. Barlar and his first wife 
Frances Lawhorn who lived in this area in a <a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/PhelpsCemGilesCo/barlarplace.jpg">little 
house across the road</a> over on the nearby hill across Campbellsville Road. 
They told that in their earlier years the A.J. Barlar's had less than 
substantial means. A. J. worked as a farm labor hand for one of the large farms 
in the area.  After birthing the family of three boys and a girl in 1889 
Frances took sick and died and was laid to rest here in the Phelps Cemetery.
<br/>
Imaging that, have four kids on farm labor wages. Since money was scarce she was 
not given a marked headstone. At that time in 1889 only two marked stones 
were in this cemetery, but there were many burials under fieldstones. This is a 
very old cemetery.<br/>
 <br/>
In 1992 due to the abandoned condition of the unfenced part of Phelps Cemetery 
the descendents of Frances Lawhorn Barlar decided to install a memorial in the 
Gibsonville Cemetery 10 miles north of this place up Hwy 166/245. Their decision 
was based on the Gibsonville Cemetery being well maintained. In 1989 when I was 
there the 1st time there was a chain link fence around two or three monuments 
and the rest of the cemetery was infested in weeds &amp; brush and this cemetery was 
practically abandoned. Today the fenced area is well maintained as you will 
notice.  
The area outside the fence has been weeded only by cattle grazing. The cattle 
will eventually trample all the fieldstones over so that the graves will no 
longer be visibly marked by stones.  The fieldstones are just common lime 
boulders that are tall shaped. They are buried on their edge deep into the 
ground facing east/west mostly at the head of the grave and sometimes another at 
the grave foot.</p>
<p align="center"><u>Strange, 
but true to life encounter at Phelps Cemetery</u></p>
<p align="left">In the 2000 
era this cemetery entrance eluded me 
for a time after that initial visit in 1989. Because of all the farm fencing 
changes and added growth of vegetation &amp; housing I was unable to easily locate the access road 
for several years or the few times I drove by. When I drove up Hwy 166 I always looked  
left into the entrance area and tried to mark the spot in my mind.  As I was 
driving by there on one occasion about 1995 I noticed two elderly ladies sitting 
in the middle of the farm road to the cemetery. Though I felt that unusual, I 
took the occasion to stop and inquire of them to try to regain the knowledge of where 
the entrance road was located. I struck up a conversation with them &amp; naturally 
I told them about the Barlar ancestor of mine interred there.  When the 
subject came up as to why they were just sitting there in the middle of the 
cemetery road in the middle of no where, in this very rural area, their answer 
was that they were going to be buried in this cemetery when they died, and they 
just wanted to be familiar with this place. Now that is the first 
&amp; last time I have encountered that situation in a cemetery. I thought it a bit strange, but then 
maybe not. I did not ask them their names and would keep it private if I knew. 
Having relocated where the Phelps Cemetery road entrance was I drove on my way to 
Maury County in search of another elusive ancestral cemetery there. A few years later a 
house was built in front of the cemetery road and then a locked gate was installed 
along with the farm pond dug south of the cemetery.  Years later (2015) 
these ladie's niece (Rhonda) informed me that they lived here and was to be 
interred here and thus felt a closeness to this place. </p>
