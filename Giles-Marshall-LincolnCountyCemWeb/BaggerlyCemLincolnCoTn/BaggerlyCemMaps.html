</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Location: From 
Taft Tennessee go east toward Fayetteville 2/3 mile and turn north on Robertson 
Hollow Rd. Follow that to the Perry Road branch to the left. Take that for 1/4 
mile and the cemetery (with permission) is back in a field 300 yards due east 
under the forest. The actual entrance to this cemetery may not be this route, 
but this is the easiest route. The route from Robertson Hollow Rd is a very 
steep climb.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery on the right after one passes the house and 
building. It is outlined in yellow here. I doubt if the right of way to the 
cemetery is from Perry Rd. In fact if a home is built here on this for sale land 
you will probably not have an access to the cemetery from the west. The house on 
the corner is not friendly to visitors having a chain linked fence and no 
trespassing signs.<br>
