<p>In spite of the restoration this cemetery has grown back up. I had to use 
a machete for 20 minutes to clear the giant Polk Berry stalks so I could get 
into the fenced area and make these photos. Also I failed to see the metal plaque 
by the fence and also went back later to look for the graves across the road, 
but was unable to locate that. So I saw no sign of a cemetery across the road.&nbsp; 
Maybe the stones across the road are fallen or maybe they are there in unmarked 
graves. There is a narrow tree line along the road which did not look 
substantial enough to include a graveyard. Since two trips did not explain this 
cemetery I will leave it to posterity to figure out the missing details. There 
was a field road that paralleled the highway which I followed and I only stopped 
to examine possible locations twice so maybe I missed it in my haste.</p>
