<b>Located on Newman Hollow Road turn north from Bryson onto Bunker Hill Road. Go 
to Newman Hollow Road and turn (left) west.&nbsp; Cross the bridge and go past the Indian 
Creek Cemetery (black) on your right upon the bank of the road. Next pass the 
historic Bethany Cemetery on the left. A bit further down and just before you go under Interstate 65 
the cemetery will be on your right &amp; maintained by a utility department ground 
keeper. You must get permission to pass a private gate to get into there. The 
cemetery is not visible from the road because a hedge is present along the right 
side of the road. The GPS Coordinates provided on this map do not match the 
above map. Use the above map because it is closer scale. The GPS as calculated 
on the above road map is slightly in error.</b><br>
