  <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080" size="2">Location: From Fayetteville go southwest 
(right) on 
Hwy 110 (Ardmore Highway) about 7 miles. Go past Skinem, almost to Kirkland and 
turn (north) right on Camargo Rd. Follow that a couple of miles and turn left 
(west) on Yukon Rd. Follow that less than three miles until it junctions with 
Red Hill Road and turn right (north) on Red Hill Road and go to Blair Hollow 
Road and turn left and (after permission) the gate to the cemetery is just out 
from the intersection on your left. Be sure to close the gate behind you at all 
times. Walk due south on the left side of the pond following the right side of 
the tree lined hedge until the hedge widens. The cemetery is there under the 
trees about 350 yards from the road. It is divided by a fence row with the 
unmarked graves south of the marked graves and across the fence. 
You will need some way to cross the fences with damaging them to see the whole 
cemetery. A small light weight aluminum two sided ladder is good for that or 
just lye flat on the ground and roll/slide under the fence but be certain there 
is a short grassy area with no cattle dung or poison ivy in your path.<br>
