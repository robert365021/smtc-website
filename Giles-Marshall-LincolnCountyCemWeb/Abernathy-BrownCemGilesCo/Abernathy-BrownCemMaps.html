This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Abernathy-Brown Cemetery. The map is 
incorrectly labeled as the Birdsong Cemetery. Birdsongs did own the place at one 
time.<br>

Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski and turn east (left) on Tarpley Shop Road. Go 
about 2 1/2 miles and stop near a thicket on the south side of the road and the 
cemetery is in that thicket. The cemetery is shown above mis labeled as the 
Birdsong Cemetery. The Birdsong Cemetery is about 800 yards northeast of this 
one.<br>
