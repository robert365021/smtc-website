I disagree with the assignment of stones to the listings on findagrave. 
The dirty but very old stone uncovered next to the tree I believe belongs as the 
footstone for Col J. Hester. and the stone lying near the George Cunningham 
monument belongs as the footstone for George Cunningham, but I could be wrong, 
because I know the stone near George Cunningham has no inscribed initials.</p>
