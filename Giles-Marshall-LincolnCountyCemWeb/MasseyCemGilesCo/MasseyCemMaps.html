  turn left at Anthony Hill onto Oak Grove Road. Turn left at fork in road which is Oak Grove
  &amp; Dog
  Branch Roads. Travel down Dog Branch Road about 1 miles &amp; you will come
  to a sharp curve in the road. After rounding the curve look to your left for a house. The Cemetery is between the house and road upon a slight incline under trees.</b></font><img border="0" src="MasseyCemAerial1.jpg" width="937" height="429"><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><br>
  This Aerial Map shows the place along the road where the cemetery can be found.
  There was a new house under construction just east of the cemetery when I visited here.
  The cemetery may now be located between this house and the road and the grass may
  now be maintained as a part of that house.</b></font><br>
