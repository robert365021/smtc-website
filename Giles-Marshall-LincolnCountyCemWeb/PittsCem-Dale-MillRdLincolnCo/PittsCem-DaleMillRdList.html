it is not for the faint of heart. There are many bee hives kept on the premises 
of the cemetery.&nbsp; I once kept bees a long time ago and learned that one 
must not alarm them to keep the peace. That requires you to move very slowly 
around their hives. The closer you get to the hive the slower you must move or 
they will attack you. This is your hazard while visiting this cemetery. Some of 
these hives were not very alive with bees and the ones remaining were somewhat 
neglected so their populations were not great.</b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
However, 
I was unable to properly photograph some of the stones because that would have 
required me to first cut the weeds and growth. Of course that would have alarmed the 
bees and got them into an uproar and charging after me. Once stirred up they cannot be 
outrun. A few will pursue you for a long time and they will eventually catch up 
with you when you tire out. Thus we have a less than 
perfect survey here.</b></font></p>
