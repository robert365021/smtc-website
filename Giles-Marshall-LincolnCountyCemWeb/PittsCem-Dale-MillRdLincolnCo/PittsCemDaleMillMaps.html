Location: From 
Fayetteville go south on Hwy 231 and turn right on Molino Rd. (before the Hwy 
110 turn off also to the right). Follow Molino Rd more than 5 miles and turn 
south (left) on Sherfield Road. Go about a half mile and turn right into Dale 
Mill Road. Follow that until it nearly ends and look onthe left at a gate which 
will take you into the pasture and too the cemetery. Visiting this cemetery is 
not for the faint of heart as there are many bee hives here kept on the premises 
of the cemetery.&nbsp; I once kept bees in hives a long time ago and learned 
that to not alarm them one must moves very slowly. The closer you get to the 
hive the slower you must move or they will attack you. Thus is your hazard in 
visiting this cemetery. Some of these hives were not alive with bees and the 
ones remaining were being neglected so their populations were not great.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
I was unable to properly photograph some of the stones because that would have 
required me to sling blade the weeds and growth. That would have alarmed the 
bees and got them into an uproar and after me. Once stirred up they cannot be 
outrun as a few will pursue you for a long time. Thus we have a less than 
perfect survey.<br>
