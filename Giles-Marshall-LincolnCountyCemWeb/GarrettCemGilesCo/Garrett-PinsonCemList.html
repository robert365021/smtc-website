</a>This cemetery saddens me greatly. It is abandoned and viciously grown up in
brush. Even though there is a rock wall surrounding it to protect it from the
livestock the vegetative growth is an equally vicious destroyer inside the
cemetery premise. So vicious that the stones are being toppled by large trees
and brush crowding them out and uprooting the balance of the stones toppling and
breaking them up. We are quick to cite vandals as destroyers of cemeteries and
they are, but this cemetery is a prime example of a cemetery being slowly
destroyed by excessive and out of control vegetation. A good application of
Roundup will help here for a couple of years, but first one must determine if
that is OK to use around the horses and livestock in the surrounding
field.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>One sometimes wonders what brings folks with
different surname backgrounds together. In this case the Pinsons &amp; Garretts
interred in this cemetery. If we read into what the above cemetery is telling us
the Garrets are the predominant family here. However Obadiah &amp; Sally Pinson
also pioneers here had a daughter who was Irena Pinson. Irena married Benjamin Garrett. So it
appears Irena's parents the Pinsons' followed the Garretts' to this area (or
were here already) and were thus invited to be buried in this the Garrett
Cemetery along side the Garretts'.&nbsp;</p>
