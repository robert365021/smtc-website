follow that for a couple of miles and turn left on Old Molino Rd.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
Follow that for about 3 miles and just before Luttrell Road on your left is a 
field road that takes you to the cemetery.<br>

This map shows the (right) turn off into the field road about the last curve in Molina Road before 
approaching 
Luttrell Road. With permission the road goes south of and beside a barn, but if you follow the road into the 
second big field you will be faced with a fence between you and the cemetery. So 
just before you cross into the 2nd big field meander right along and between the 
trees to the cemetery northwest of you. You can see that with the yellow 
highlighted pathway. If you have done it right there will be a tree lined 
hedgerow on your left thru the whole trip off Old Molino Road. <br>
