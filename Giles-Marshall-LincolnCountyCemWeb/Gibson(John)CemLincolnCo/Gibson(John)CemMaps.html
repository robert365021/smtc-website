Location: From 
Fayetteville go north on Hwy 431 and before you get to the Howell community turn 
left on Clayton Lane. Go to the end of Clayton Lane and turn right (north) and go 
up that road and on into the private residential road. The cemetery is past a 
locked gate next to a modern home &amp; family at the crest of the hill. You will 
need permission and directions as this cemetery is hard to see in the summer 
time even if you stand next to it, because of having only one standing stone.<br>

This map shows the Clayton Ln you will need to gain access to this cemetery, at 
the John Crawford Cemetery on your right travel north until that road ends and 
turn right and follow the residential road to the home on top of the hill and 
the Cemetery is in the side yard and with the brush covering it. </b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
