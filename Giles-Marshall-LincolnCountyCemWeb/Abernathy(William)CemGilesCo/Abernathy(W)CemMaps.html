Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski and turn east (left) on Amos Hamlet Road. Go 3/4 of 
a mile and turn right into the driveway of a residence (with permission). Stop on 
the driveway and look (right) southeast over a rise out into a pasture at the cemetery under a clump 
of trees. The cemetery may be hard to see because it is behind the rise from the 
driveway.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery under the trees. It is out in a field in a 
clump of trees on the west side of an old house. This is on Britton Branch Creek 
which crosses the road shown here as a string of trees going north/south.<br>
