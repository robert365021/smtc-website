I'm trying to re-locate William Abernathy's grave in the William Abernathy 
Cemetery in Giles Co, TN. About 15 years ago I found it in the weed/bushes on 
Stovall Rd. Unfortunately I did not make pictures or record the exact location. 
Recently I've been back twice to find it to no avail. Does anyone know WHERE on 
Stovall Rd this is located? A GPS would be awesome to have! My memory is that it 
is about 100 ft from the road and in a curve. Thanks for any help anyone can 
give me. Dixie Waters, dswdew@bellsouth.net</span><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Added

Dixie I have him listed without a headstone in the Wm. Abernathy Cemetery. That 
is probably because that is how the Giles Co. Cemetery book had him listed . 
However, they acknowledged there was no re-survey because it was grown up.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

Sorry you cannot find that location,&nbsp;because that probably explains why I could 
not find a&nbsp;headstone in the William Abernathy Cemetery, because there was not one.</span></strong></p>

There is only one&nbsp;large bend in the Stovall Road. Remember which way the road 
bent? This awfully long URL should take you to a bend in the Stovall Road. If 
you can detail the spot from memory it would be a way to get the GPS. This is 
the best GPS map out there in general use:</span></strong></p>

				My family and I (14 of us) recently toured the cemeteries of 
				Giles Co that had our blood line kin in them (5 cemeteries in 
				all). First I�ve learned via a descendant (Lisa) of Wm Abernathy 
				(1742-1832) who via her mother owns the �Abernathy farm� at 
				1600(?) Amos Hamlett Rd.&nbsp; She maintains the cemetery in their 
				side yard and does a great job; <b>her mother is sure there used 
				to be a stone there for the above Wm</b>.&nbsp; Lisa lives in 
				Hartselle, AL but goes to the farm occasionally, plus she rents 
				the farm to a nearby farmer.&nbsp; <br>
				Have I mentioned to you about knocking on the door of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
				�red roof� house on Stovall Rd. The resident was a �civil war 
				re-enactor� and stated there was no cemetery between he and the 
				1<sup>st</sup> red roof house.&nbsp; I know you�ve probably done more 
				research on this than I, so if you have thoughts on this let me 
				know.&nbsp; For interest sake I did relate to my relatives the Amos H 
				Rd place is where Wm b. 1742 is buried.</span></p>

				Second, regarding&nbsp; Bee Spring cemetery and John Abernathy 
				1785-1861:&nbsp; I had my niece take pictures of the old broken 
				marker beside the new one; she was to put it on the Find a Grave 
				but I don�t see it yet or maybe one can�t replace the photo 
				already on there?&nbsp;(not a problem) Anyway I have contacted her; 
				have not heard back yet.&nbsp; If she is having a problem, we may 
				call on you to help?</span></p>

&nbsp;<p>Wow must have been fun to go exploring cemeteries like that. I had one 
		time like that years ago. No I have done less than you on this Stovall 
		Road Cemetery query,&nbsp;but thought it looked like a&nbsp;cem on Google maps 
		between the 2nd red roof house and a red roof shed behind it, but 
		nevertheless if the guy there did not know of a cemetery that close to 
		his house then case closed,&nbsp;as it must not be there.&nbsp;He is not likely to 
		have wanted to&nbsp;deceive you. But you mentioned in your earlier query 
		Stoval Road&nbsp;leaving me to go roaming Google maps looking for it, but now 
		deny it so or disclaim it&nbsp;so OK. I do though follow all leads to find 
		lost cemeteries and many of them have dead ends as it seems this one 
		does. C. Wayne Austin 11 Jun 2015</div>
