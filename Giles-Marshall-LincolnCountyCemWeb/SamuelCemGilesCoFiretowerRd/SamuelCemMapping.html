</b></font><b><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Location: Go 
northeast of Pulaski on Hwy 31 Alt aka Lewisburg Highway, to the second intersection of Fire tower Road 
on the left.&nbsp;The cemetery is today in a cow pasture of the large triangular 
shaped section of land bounded on the northeast &amp; southwest sides by Fire Tower Road 
and on the southeast by Hwy 31 Alt. (Lewisburg Hwy). Fire tower Road has a 
north entrance nearer I-65. The road starts on Hwy 31 Alt and bends back and 
ends on the same Hwy 31 Alt., leaving a large triangular shaped chunk of land on 
its inside. </font><font color="#CC3300" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">
Specifics: Turn left into Fire tower Road from the north entrance and go 6 
tenths of a mile and there will be an older home on your left. Go past that home 
to the driveway that goes to the house &amp; barn. This driveway is a J shaped circular drive 
that goes eventually toward the house. After permissions turn left and a gate is 
straight ahead of you after you turn right off the circular drive. Go to the 
gate &amp; walk through it keeping it closed and look straight ahead (South) 100 
feet at the cemetery out in the cow pasture. You will see two stones standing now under a small Hackberry tree 
growing up in the middle of the grave of Dorinda Samuel, the wife of William S. 
Samuel.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080" size="2"><br>
