</b><b>This cemetery is found on the old Whiteway Farm in the northwest junction of Buford Station &amp; Blue
Creek Roads. It sprawls over about a 2 to 3 acre area. The graves are clustered
together by families. There is a chain link fence around the Lane/McMillon/Gordon/Larkin
family Graves. Other fences crisscross the graveyard indicating a struggle for
control over property lines or ownership in the past. Outside the chain link
fence is the W.O. West family graves among other grave clusters about the area.
All the scattered graves are in danger of being lost by Mother Nature's constant
assault on old graveyards from trees &amp; bushes that bring forth forces that
uproot, crush &amp; bury the stones over time. I even failed to mention the
vandals and livestock that trample and destroy grave assets.<br>

toward Pulaski 1.3 miles (southwest) to Buford Station Road and turn (northwest) 
right. Go about 5 miles and the cemetery will be found in the junction of Buford
