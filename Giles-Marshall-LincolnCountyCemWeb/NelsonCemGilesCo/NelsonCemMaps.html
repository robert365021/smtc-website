This road map shows the cemetery on the east side of Liberty Road. From Pulaski 
go south on Highway 31 to Elkton and turn right or west on Prospect Road. Go 
about 3 miles and turn north (right) on Liberty Hill Road. Go about a 1/2 mile 
and look right at a gate and cattle feeding station. With permission go into 
that and follow the fence row east and north to a hedge row bearing to the right 
of a big pond. Find the road across the hedge row (the hedge Row is the old road 
into this cemetery). Go across the hedge row and bear right and head toward the 
edge of the woods where the cemetery will be found across a fence. <br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery route I took highlighted in yellow. You will 
not be able to go this route in wet weather. I am unaware of the old right of 
way, but it may be marked on this Google map above, but I doubt it has been 
maintained. Also ignore the road marked on the above map as Nelson Cemetery 
Road. That may be the old right of way to the Elder Cemetery but certainly not 
the Nelson Cemetery<br>
