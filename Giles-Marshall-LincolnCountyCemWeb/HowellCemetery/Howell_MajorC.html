Major C. Howell--Maury Democrat, 28 March 1889........The subject of our sketch
this week is Major C. Howell, a man of many eccentricities, was born in North
Carolina of Scotch-Irish parents, Aug. 26th, 1799 and moved to Maury Co., Tenn.
in early manhood and settled in 2 miles of the place where he died--he resided
at the same place sixty years. He was married three times--first to Miss Mary
Nance, she lived only about one year after her marriage; by her he had one
child, which survived her only a short time. In about two years after he married
a Miss Jones; she only lived two years and died leaving one child, which only survived
her a short time. In 1830 he married again, this time to Miss Mary Freeman, by
her he had 8 children, five of whom still live. Soon after this marriage he
joined that branch of the Baptist Church known as Iron-Jackets of Hard Shell
Baptists, at what was then known as Cross Roads, but now as Screamersville,
where his membership remained until his death. He was an old line Whig till the
war, but from then always voted the Democratic ticket. Some years before his
death he suffered with some affliction, and could only rest while lying on his
right side, and for this reason he called one of his daughter-in-laws to him,
and lying down on a board of plank, with his right hand under his head, foot
slightly drawn up, had his measure taken, and said he intended to make his
coffin to suit himself, and gave directions that at his death he was to be laid
in his coffin on his right side, right hand under his head, foot drawn up in the
usual position in which he rested. All of those directions were faithfully
carried out. He passed quietly out May 1888, at the ripe age of 89; the only
office he ever held was Captain of Militia. He never told a falsehood knowingly;
he died indebted to no man; was a blessing to his country and greatly missed.
