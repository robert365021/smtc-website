Columbia, Tenn., go Campbellsville Pike 10 or 12 miles and turn right on Fire
Tower Road at the Southport community. Go Fire Tower Road 3 or 4 miles, cemetery
is on the right about 1/2 mile past the fire tower. Back several years ago,
Richard Green from Texas put a sign up that says Howell Cemetery. This sign is
believed to be still visible from the road. This cemetery is in Giles County but
it is named the Elkridge Cemetery in the USGS Mapping service. Update The Howell
Cemetery was found on the west side of the road on a later visit. The Flanigan
Cemetery an African- American Cemetery is just down the road on the opposite (east) side of
the road.<br>

DANIEL BOONE 
EXPLORES connections with BENJAMIN CUTBIRTH, Sr.



</h1>

<p>
Benjamin
Cutbirth, Sr was born about 1740 in either Augusta Co., VA or
Pennsylvania. In 1761, he married


Elizabeth Boone Wilcocksen, a niece of Daniel Boone, in the Yadkin Forks
region of North Carolina, where he had located a year earlier. Daniel Boone Cutbirth, the first of their four
children, was born in 1763. Ben, Jr was born about 1765, Mary in 1771 and Sarah in 1772. All the children were born
in the Watauga area of North Carolina.</p>
<p>
Cutbirth was reputed to be a longhunter with Daniel Boone, the two saving
each other's lives several times. In Clark's Kentucky: A Land of Contrast, &quot;Longhunting was not an unknown
pastime for Daniel Boone. He had hunted with such seasoned woodsmen as Benjamin Cutbirth for game and land
along the Watauga in Eastern Tennessee.&quot; Believed to be the one who introduced Daniel Boone to the
Kentucky wilderness, only Cutbirth's illiteracy kept him from becoming as famous as Boone himself. Cutbirth and
three others are considered to be the first white men to reach the Mississippi River overland in about 1767,
viewing the river from the Missouri Boot Heel area. They took the pelts they had collected south to sell them in New
Orleans and returned through the Indian Territory of present-day Mississippi and Alabama, only to be robbed of
their earnings by a band of Indians.

</p>
<p>
Cutbirth is shown as a resident of Tennessee in 1794, in Johnson County. In
1799, he sold his lands in East Tennessee and left for Middle Tennessee, where in 1807 he was one of the
signers on a petition to form Maury County. He lived briefly in the Shoal Creek area of Alabama in the Cherokee
Nation and then moved back to Maury County, where he shows up on a tax list for 1811 with his son, Daniel.
(The August 25, 1814 issue of The Columbia Chronicle includes his name among petitioners who were forced off
the Cherokee land.) Cutbirth died about 1817 and is <font color="#ff0000">buried in Major Howell Cemetery in
Giles County. His wife Elizabeth died in 1819 and is buried beside him.</font></p>
<p>
Listed by the DAR as a Revolutionary patriot, Cutbirth was once held hostage
in his own home by a band of Tories. His exploits have been honored by a marker in Kentucky, which
commemorates the service of all those who helped cut the Wilderness Road. The marker reads (in part): &quot;In
testimony of the gratitude of posterity for the historic service of cutting the Transylvania Trail �the first great
pathway to the West, March - April 1755, from Long Island of � Holston River, Tennessee, to � Otter Creek in
Kentucky, by a gallant band of axemen, pioneers and Indian fighters, who � opened the doors of destiny to �
Kentucky and the West.&quot;
