are looking into the cemetery at the few formal memorials and some inscribed
fieldstones and perhaps hundreds of fieldstones marking graves. No one knows who
is buried here. Back to our right is the stone
of Major C. Howell and wife and to our left is the stone of Seley C. Norman.&nbsp;<br>

view looking at the area photo of the Major C. Howell memorial and an unknown
fieldstone marker may just mark the grave of Polley E. his wife though her
inscription is shown on the bottom of his. </span></p>
