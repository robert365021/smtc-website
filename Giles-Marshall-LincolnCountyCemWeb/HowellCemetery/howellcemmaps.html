It was later determined when I visited
  this cemetery that this map was marked 1/4 mile to the north. The Howell
  Cemetery is actually
  in Giles County at spot on this map called CEM on Topographical maps and 
	others have is named Elkridge Cemetery. Nevertheless it is actually found at 
	GPS 35.4485N X -87.1316W.</b><b>&nbsp;<br>

</b><b>On this map the cemetery is called the Elk Ridge Cemetery. It is actually 
	the Howell Cemetery. Also there is an African American American Cemetery 
	just south of here and on the other side of the road called the Flannigan 
	Cemetery. It is unmapped and also 
further east one can see the old New Hope Cemetery also an African American 
cemetery.<br>
