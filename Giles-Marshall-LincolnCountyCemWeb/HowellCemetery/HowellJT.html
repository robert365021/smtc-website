Jackson T., son of Major C. Howell. I think he is listed in the book
&quot;They Passed this Way&quot; One thing I do have in my notes on Jackson T.
Howell, is on 8/22/1988, we talked to his granddaughter, Rosie Howell Hudspeth
(now deceased). I know I spelled her last name wrong for a long time and I'm not
for sure if I corrected it on my notes. It may be Hedgespeth. I have notes from looking at her bible and Jackson T. did die in
1897. I have him being born Nov. 19,
1849 even though it's not on this fieldstone. Only the initials J T H is here on this
fieldstone and the date (_5?) 1897. </span><center><i>Photo
