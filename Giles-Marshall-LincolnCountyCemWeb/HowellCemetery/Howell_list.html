Did you know that Major Howell had a son named Major Howell whom I believe was 
involved in the Civil War killing of my third great uncle William Fine Coffee.
<br>
This son fled to KY after his accomplice Samuel Morrow was likewise killed 
probably by the interest of Coffee. I have been in discussion of this recently 
with a <br>
descendent of this Howell by the name of Don Howell who still lives in the 
Western KY area. This Major Howell was paired with a Samuel Morrow in the 
killing.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
wcarol:<br>
Yikes!! So he was your third great uncle?

No, this was Major Howell, son 
of Daniel Howell...have census 
records for him showing him having a son named Major. Daniel Howell<br>
lived on the Maury Co. side of Southport...he is listed in census records as a 
miller. All the old people we talked to back in the 80's knew of the Old Howell 
Mill and<br>
we thought it was Major's mill, but Major was listed as a farmer in census 
records, Daniel was listed as a miller, so evidently Daniel Howell ran the 
Howell Mill. <br>
That Daniel Howell was a mean dude!! :) and it sounded like his son Major was 
also mean!<br>
<br>
From the book &quot;They Passed This Way&quot;, Vol. II, page 276...<br>
Howell, Daniel, a jury of inquest to inquire how and when and in what manner 
Daniel Howell came to his death on April 19, 1861...one W.H. Esom in his own 
necessary self defense<br>
to save himself from death or great bodily harm by the violence of the said 
Daniel Howell , the said W.H. Esom did then and there kill the said Daniel 
Howell by striking him<br>
on the head two blows with a small hand mall.<br>
We do not know where Daniel Howell is interred (probably on his own farm 
somewhere on the Maury County side of the Giles Maury County Line.)<p><b>
