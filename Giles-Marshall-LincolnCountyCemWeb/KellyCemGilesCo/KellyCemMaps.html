This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Kelly Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="KellyCemRd.jpg" width="1598" height="701"><br>
From Pulaski go south on Hwy 31 to Elkton and turn right on Prospect Road (Hwy 
273). Go about three miles and cross the bridge and with permission turn right 
(north) up a private Farm Operation Road. Go past the Silos and the cemetery is 
on the right side of the metal building complex.<br>
<img border="0" src="KellyCemAerial.jpg" width="1575" height="611"><br>
This aerial map shows the cemetery well maintained. The road to the cemetery 
also doubles as the road to an unused residence and also to the farm operation so besure you go here with deliberate upscale intentions and secure permission 
as there are expensive assets here that would arouse suspicion without 
deliberation with the owner.<br>
