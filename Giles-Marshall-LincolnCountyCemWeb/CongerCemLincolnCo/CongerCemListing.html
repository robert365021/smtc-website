<font color="#800000" size="2">The setting of the plaque and celebration of the 
life of Henry Moores. This Daughters of the American Revolution placed this 
during 1975 so the photo was taken then. The Henry Moores Chapter was based in 
Texarkana, Texas/Arkansas. Henry Moores was a veteran of the Revolutionary war. 
He was Carolyn Whitaker Crowley's third-great-grandfather. Wayne Owens 
identified the only person known as Ruth Morgan seen in the left center.<br/>

It is my opinion the two stones found by previous transcribers and not found 
in 2011 are there. They may have sunken below the soil level. The fence is down in this cemetery and the cattle roam thru the cemetery at 
will. Much of the evidence for unmarked graves is gone and very difficult 
to determine now. You will notice a rock wall to the south of the cemetery that 
could be an attempt to surround the cemetery or it may be a part of a building 
such as a church which once stood here. Someone recently added a split rail 
fence on three sides of the cemetery also. <br/>

</b>I was shown this cemetery by Mr. Conger who descends from the folks buried in 
this cemetery. His family home (adjacent to here) was built in 1808 and is known 
as the historic Conger Log Cabin, or the oldest known home in Lincoln County 
Tennessee. The home location is visible from a map under mapping the location and it lies 
to the east of the cemetery. The home was opened recently by the Congers for the 
"Alpha Kappa Home Tour" a historic tour of Fayetteville Tennessee Homes Sunday 
13 Nov 2011. However let us remember the place is otherwise private.</font></p>

Our thanks to Mr. Conger, the landowner &amp; descendent of this cemetery, a long time resident, who showed this us the cemetery. 
The cemetery is listed in the book "Cemetery Records of Lincoln County 
Tennessee" by Tim &amp; Helen Crawford Marsh, page 175. That book still has the most 
complete listing of graves in Lincoln County today, even if many sources are 
popping up on the internet. I present complete cemeteries but will not present 
all of them. Findagrave.com researchers tend to emphasize there own kin and rarely 
finish a cemetery completely. Others that try are somehow not self trained so 
the effort falls short of what you will find in the book or here. </font></i></b></p>
