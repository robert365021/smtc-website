southwest on Hwy 11 (Minor Hill Highway) to Minor Hill and turn right on 
Puncheon Road and go about 3 miles. Pass Sugar Creek Road and the Puncheon 
Church of Christ on your left and then go about 1/4 miles. The cemetery is on 
your right upon the hill above you. You must have permission from the gentleman 
who owns the house at the second driveway going up the slope. However in wet or 
slick weather you cannot climb his driveway as of now. His driveway winds to the 
west then bends back east as it climbs the steep road. He has a nice place at 
the top and dogs that are part of your greeting. Until your purpose is 
established as innocent you will be greeted mildly/coldly by the owner as I was.</b></font><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080" size="2"><br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery at a flat place near the top of the hill. The 
cemetery is in the woodland and my instructions from the owner was to follow his 
continuing drive east until it dead ended about another 30 yards at an old pink 
bath tub used as a plant growing medium. Continue east (straight out from the 
driveway) for about 100 yards and the little white cemetery stones can be seen 
in the woodland. It is my opinion that the cemetery is actually over to our 
right a bit further and slightly south. I say that because of the eastward 
direction I traveled to get there from the gentleman's house. The roof of his 
house can barely be seen on Google Aerial maps among the trees so the cemetery 
should be slightly north, but east from his home about 130 yards.<br>
