The center of the map
shows
the location of the White-Lawrence Cemetery shown as the White Cemetery on the
above mapping. This cemetery is detailed in the USGS records.
I have provided this map to show the GPS coordinates. The GPS Latitude
&amp; Longitude are correct as shown above.</p>

map shows the White-Lawrence Cemetery located on the Hagan Road, but that is not
labeled on this map.&nbsp;<br>
Directions: Take Hwy 166 south from the center of Pulaski about 11 miles and go
to Hagan Road and turn right (west). Go abt 2 1/4 miles to the second right turn.
Turn into that and follow along for 1 mile to the Shoals Bluff Church of Christ
on your left. Go past there for another 300 yards and the cemetery is on the
right side of the road.</b></span><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

This Aerial view shows the roads and landscape you will encounter as you
approach the cemetery. I am unaware if the names of the roads shown on
this map are correct. Lots of errors in these maps now days, but the detail is plentiful enough to
find this location irrespective of incorrect road names.&nbsp;
