Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski and turn west (right) on the 64 bypass and then back 
left (south) on Chicken Creek Road. Pass Richardson Road on the right and Short 
Road on the left. Go another 1/2 mile and the cemetery is behind and NW of the Waldon family 
home which used to be the Kennedy family farm. Mr. Waldon's wife inherited the 
place from her mother who was a Kennedy and I think somewhere back in the line 
were the Abernathys'. Mrs. Waldon said that the Pittards' were friends of the 
Abernathy's in the community. I suspect if one follows the information trail there 
is a marriage somewhere that helped seal a family connection. This is the graves 
of the Charles Grandison Pittard b. 1809 and the William D. Abernathy b. 1800 
families. To get there from standing at the Waldon home looking at the home one 
goes left across the creek; to the left of the barn, and up the slope. Cross over 
a tree line (thru an opening going northwest). Then follow a small narrow cleared area back to 
the cemetery located to the right 50 feet of a giant Pin Oak tree. This is 
northwest of the home about 400 yards. This cleared area is mowed by Mr. Waldon. 
If he ever gets to the point he is unable to do that then all the vegetation 
will change.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery under the trees out northwest from the Waldon 
home which is back from the road a few hundred yards.<br>
