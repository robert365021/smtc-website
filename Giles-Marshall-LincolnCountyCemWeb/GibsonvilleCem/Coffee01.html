While living at Stiversville, Marvin and Lillian Duncan Coffee had three
children that were born and died in childhood. These were Dannie Wright &amp;
Mary Lurline &amp; Christine Coffee all girls. One died of pneumonia near the
time of the great flu epidemic (abt 1918); one died of burns when her dress
caught fire at a heater and she ran out to her mother in the back yard. Ella
Virginia Coffee Stevens, a sister of the above children, says she doesn't recall
which of these two children burned or which child died of pneumonia. The third
child Christine died while Marvin and Lillian were living in Lynnville.
Christine was an invalid at birth. Linda's mother (Ella Virginia) is the oldest
child who survived those hard early years.)<i><br>
