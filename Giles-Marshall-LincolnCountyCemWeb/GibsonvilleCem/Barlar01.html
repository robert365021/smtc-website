Fieldstones abound everywhere many of which are graphically pointed out with a
black arrow in this photo. This is in the Phelps Cemetery on the outside of the
fence on the northwest side of the fenced area. One of these or another in the
surrounding area likely belongs to the grave of Frances Lawhorn Barlar. She
married Alfred Jordan Barlar and had three sons and one daughter. Sometime after
the birth of the last son Isaac Leonard was born in 1887 she (abt 1889) died
likely of one of the many infectious diseases of the times.<br>
