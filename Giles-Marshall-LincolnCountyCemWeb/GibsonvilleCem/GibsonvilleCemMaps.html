  Loc</b><b>ation: From Pulaski take the highway 64
  West a mile or so and turn right (north) on Highway 166. Follow that for about
  14 miles and turn right on Highway 245 toward Columbia Tennessee. Follow Hwy
  245 for more than 5 miles and after you pass Waco Road the cemetery is just up
  the road on the right before you come to Blue Branch Road upon a hill above
  the road under Cedar Trees. Cemetery can be seen from the road. The Cemetery
  is fenced and signs maintained. Keep the gate closed to prevent cattle from
  entering the cemetery if you go here.<br>
