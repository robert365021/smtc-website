<blockquote>

<p>I was shown this massive granite slab style tomb 
by Mr. James Long a nearby resident. We are unaware if there are family members 
interred in this area along with the family cemetery upon the hill. The tomb 
occupies only a small part of the area of this grove of trees where the Isaac 
Morris Cemetery is located. This slab was added here in recent years between the 
years 1950 - 2000 and appears to replace some kind of earlier monument that was 
failing. <b><i>
