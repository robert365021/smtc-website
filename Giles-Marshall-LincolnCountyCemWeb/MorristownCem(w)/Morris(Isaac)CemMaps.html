Go 600 yards and look right at a metal cattle gate and on out across that you will see the cemetery 
in the distance - southwest about 167 yards in a clump of trees.

This map shows both the Isaac Morris grave on our left on the west side 
of Little Dry Creek Road and the Morris Town Cemetery on the right side of 
Little Dry Creek Road. This is just a way to locate both of these cemeteries as 
the interred here are part of the same family, but there is a black cemetery 
adjacent to the Morristown Cemetery previously called Morristown (black) 
Cemetery. It now may be called the Good Hope Cemetery by the black community.<br>

Here we see the Isaac Morris Cemetery in the distant clump of trees out in a 
field. It would be my suspicions that Isaac died rather suddenly probably of an 
infectious disease and was immediately buried here likely on his property as he died 
16 years after his wife Susannah had already been buried upon the hill in the 
family cemetery there.<i><br>
