This map shows the coordinates of the McGee Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="McGeeCemRd.jpg" width="1598" height="774"><br>
From Hwy 50 (Lynchburg Hwy) take Booneville Road north (left) to Ashby Road and 
again turn left. Go half mile &amp; turn left into the field road that seems to be 
dedicated to the cemetery though it may have locked gates and/or fences. 
Cemetery about 170 yards down that road behind a barn. Someone recently cleared 
the cemetery before I was there and may be caring for it now.&nbsp; <br>

This aerial map shows with a red check the cemetery down what seems like a right-of-way 
road. Be sure you go here with deliberate upscale intentions and secure 
permission if needed as this is probably not a public cemetery.<br>
