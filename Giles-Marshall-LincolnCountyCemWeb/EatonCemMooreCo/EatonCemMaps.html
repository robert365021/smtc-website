  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From the center of Lynchburg take Highway 50 
southwest out of Lynchburg, 
(Moore County) and go about a mile and 1/4 and pass over the East Fork of 
Mulberry Creek. Just before crossing over the creek look left at the new signage 
Eaton Cemetery. Turn around at a convenient place and go back across the creek 
again viewing the cemetery the 2nd time being careful of the busy traffic. About 
a 150 years after you cross over the Creek turn right into the Old Fayetteville 
Hwy as shown on the map below and park on the right side of the highway. Walk 
back to the right-of-way for Hwy 50 and cross and follow down the mowed area of 
the right of way to the cemetery. Have a small light aluminum ladder with you to 
cross the fence without damaging it. If you don't have a ladder continue on 
nearly to the creek and the fence fizzles out and you can cross over and return 
(U-turn) to the cemetery. (Though I give you these instructions I take no 
responsibility for your safely in applying them and neither your general safety 
either because this is a bit of a rough entrance. However, any other entrance to 
this cemetery will get you scratched from the prolific black berry vines. Do not 
climb on the fences either or &quot;Snuffy Smiff&quot; the farmer will get his &quot;shooting 
armaments&quot; after you.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows a very yellow rough graphic I applied to the image to 
outline the cemetery. I repeat, do not attempt to access this cemetery from Hwy 
50, or you will endanger your life.<br>
