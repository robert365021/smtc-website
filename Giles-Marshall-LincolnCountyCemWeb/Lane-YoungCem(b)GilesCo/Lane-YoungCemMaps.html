<img border="0" src="Lane-YoungCemRd.jpg" width="1599" height="752"><br>
From Exit 6 on I-65 go east toward Fayetteville on Dellrose Rd. about three 
miles and turn south on Wheelerton Rd. Go about 3 tenths of a mile and look left 
up the slope behind a house and the cemetery is on the ridge at the top of the 
slope. It seems to be maintained as part of someone's back yard but is north and 
slightly east 
from the house. It is reported for the other Young Cemetery shown southeast on 
the above map (1/2 mile) reports no formal headstones.<br>

fence.<br>
