		I was told the area back in this little snug cove was on a road to 
		Campbellsville or some other place such as Wales at one time and there 
		was an old school here in this valley. There is
		<a href="VaughnCemeteryTopoz.jpg">another graveyard</a> several hundred 
		yards to the east of this place where only fieldstones mark the graves. 
		It is at the top of a tall hill. This could mean that graveyard was the 
		slave graveyard if his family were slave owners or it may be a graveyard 
		for children that died in the old school, among other possibilities. <br>
