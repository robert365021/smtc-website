Fayetteville go southwest on Hwy 110 (Ardmore Hwy) for about 13 miles passing Skinem, Taft, Blanche &amp; Roper. About a mile before you get to Ardmore turn north 
(right) on Henry Bayless Road and go about 2.5 miles along the way passing over 
Lewter Hollow Rd. aka Elliott Rd..&nbsp; After Leweter Hollow Rd go about 6 
tenths of a mile and you will see the large Malone Cem on your left. Pass beyond the 
Malone Cemetery about 200 yards and with permission and in dry weather turn into a 
field (sorta) road that goes west (left). Follow along the fence row on your 
right until that ends or bends back north (your right). The end of the fence row 
is at about 3 tenths of a mile. After that turn your vehicle (1/2 right) 
northwest toward an opening in the distant north/south brush lined fence row. Cross 
over the opening in the fence row and after crossing that fence row turn left 90 degrees toward 
the cemetery and you will find it is in a thicket ahead of you in about a 1/2 
acre of Blackberry briars and Sage grass (currently but the briars will 
disappear as trees grow up and shelter that out. Then you may have privy hedge 
(if the rain continues) and you will&nbsp;have to cut that to get into the 
place. The fence someone built in about 2005 is fallen down in two places but there 
were no cattle to trample the cemetery down and knock the stones over. From how 
I map this cemetery it is located about 50 yards east of the Giles/Lincoln County 
line inside Lincoln County. The above map shows the county line as a yellow &amp; 
black dotted color.<br>

In this view we noted the cemetery from various view points. Some of the above 
labels will change as the new unchecked growth begins to fester the cemetery. My 
honest opinion is the cemetery clearers did this cemetery no help by clearing 
the Vinca Minor and the (at least the small trees on the east and south sides of 
the cemetery.&nbsp; Trees at that time were sheltering out the vicious&nbsp;brush that can 
quickly cause a cemetery to be uninhabitable given the continuation of the wet 
summers we are currently having. Really though it take a trained eye to know if 
a tree threatens the cemetery. the subject is too comprehensive to cover here.<br>
