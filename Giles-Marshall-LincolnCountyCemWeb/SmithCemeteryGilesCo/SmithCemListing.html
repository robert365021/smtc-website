<PRE>	This cemetery was called the Pulley Cemetery in the book Giles County Tennessee Cemeteries after the family that first? lived here.  It was found on maps and photographed as the Smith Cemetery by this author
	so I am using that naming designation.
	I was shown this cemetery by the pleasant (black) gentleman who owns the land. For security reasons I will not mention names, but he says he has tried unsuccessful for years to get help from the (white) descendents
	of this cemetery to keep it clean of brush. He does his best to accomplish that, but is overwhelmed by the large area and out of control vegetation. He had already amassed a pile of brush and said he would burn it in
	time. I cautioned him that one should never let fire get too close to the stones. To allow the stones to reach a hot temperature would cause them to start crumbling apart over time. Unfortunately if a forest fire
	swept through there it was have that same consequence. [CWA 19 Jul 2010]
