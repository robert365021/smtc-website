  Joseph and his son A. J. were killed when a train hit the<br>
  wagon they were in. Joseph has two tombstones, one for<br>
  him &amp; A. J. when they were killed and this one, which sets to the<br>
  left of the other one. This stone was put in when his wife Samantha died.<br>
  This stone faces west, so that the inscription is on the side Joseph is
  buried.<br>

  PULASKI CITIZEN<br>
  Aug. 25, 1887<br>
  Three men Killed<br>
  Saturday evening about six o'clock, within<br>
  a mile of Lawrenceburg, the pay train ran<br>
  into a wagon in which were seated Joe Ussery Sr.,<br>
  Joe Ussery Jr., and Charles Hinson, all residents of<br>
  Lawrence County beyond Bodenham, killing the<br>
  Elder Ussery and Hinson instantly and fatally injuring<br>
  Young Ussery who died that night. A wagon was before<br>
  them and the road crossed where the view was obstructed<br>
  by the hedge and corn. The cow-catcher struck between the<br>
  mules and the wagon, throwing the mules one way and the<br>
  wagon the other. It was running very fast. Joe Ussery was<br>
  the father of 16 children. W. W. Briggs killed one of his sons<br>
  at Campbellsville about 10 years ago.<br>
