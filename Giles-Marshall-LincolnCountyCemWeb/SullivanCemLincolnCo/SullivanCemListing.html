Findagrave.com has this cemetery well depicted and also much family history and 
old family photos. It is odd I only found one inscribed stone and they show one 
other one that I missed. However it is clear there are many fieldstones marking 
graves of the other folks listed above who have no inscribed marker. I suspect 
someone knows of the existence of all the above folks and knows they disappeared 
from the picture after burial behind the old home place so correctly concluded 
they are here in unmarked graves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
The old Sullivan home is in front of the cemetery down next to the road but in a 
near collapsed state. See findagrave for family photos of this large family. 
Upon my visit the owners or renters of the home were unhappy about what might be 
done to the cemetery to infringe upon their right to privacy. So respect that as 
best as you can if you go here. <br>
