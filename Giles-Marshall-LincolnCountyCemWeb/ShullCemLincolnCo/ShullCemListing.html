		One large rock vault without an inscription. (This 
		was not found 8 Feb 2011)<br>
		<br>
		Only the top spire of an Obelisk Memorial to D.B. &amp; Sarah Shull was 
		found. Where is the rest of this cemetery? Looks like the grounds were 
		kept since the growth found covering the area was periwinkle vine.</font></p>
