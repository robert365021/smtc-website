From Pulaski on the bypass (64) take Hwy 11 south to Anthony Hill and turn right 
on Fall River Road. Go 2 &amp; 1/2 to 3 miles and turn left on Shores Mill 
Road. Then go&nbsp;1 mile and the cemetery is on the right behind the Shores Baptist 
Church parking lot. Unless you have respect, admiration and love for the folks 
who lie here do not go to this place. The local watchman will have your number 
if you have malice or devious aims in your heart. <br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery well maintained behind the church parking lot. 
You can see a part of the parking lot in the lower part of this map image. This 
is a new cemetery, no more than 20 to 40 years old. There were only 20 burials 
in 1985. <br>
