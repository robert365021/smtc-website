Location: From 
Pulaski go north on Hwy 31 to Industrial Loop Road on your left. Turn left there 
and after a few hundred yards there will appear a bluff &amp; stream below that on 
your left. The cemetery is upon that bluff in back next to the open field. When 
you come to a house on the left there will be a short drive leading up a dead 
end before the next driveway to the house. Park in that 1st drive and climb the slope on 
your left. When you encounter a fence follow it (left) north a short 
distance toward the road until you can go around the corner of the fence without 
crossing it. Careful it is steep at that place. After that follow the fence on your 
right along the edge of the woodland staying in the woodland but traveling 
eastward. Be careful not to fall over the bluff on your left. After a 
hundred yards or so you will begin to see the stones as marked on the aerial 
view above. The cemetery is inside the woodland, but close to the open field to 
the south. The 
woodland there juts out into the field at the cemetery.</b></p>
