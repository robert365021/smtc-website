</font><i><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Judy King Sanders (the 
source author) and visitor of this cemetery in 1996 found 5 tombstones, but she 
believes that at one time, there were more. Further she says the cemetery is not 
in good condition. It is an open cemetery and cows have been allowed to roam 
over it. Some of the tombstones were lying on the ground. The inscriptions on 
the tombstones were hard to read. The last person's tombstone she found was buried over 100 
years ago. This publication was added to Familytreemaker by a Morrow researcher: 
Barbara Mandersheid. Another source is the Giles County Cemetery Historical 
Society book.&nbsp; The GSC book say also that 
Elizabeth Hickman and husband J.B. Hickman (or Morrow) is interred here without 
headstones. They offered no listings for any other burials. P 374, 
Morrow Cemetery. Cemetery &amp; Tombstone Photos by John Colvett who visited here 
recently. Revised to add John's photos in May 2015</font></i></p>
