Go east on Hwy 64 toward Fayetteville. Turn right on one of the roads that was 
old Hwy 64 toward Aymett Town (Community). After traveling 400 years on this 
road the cemetery will be on the left back up into field 50 yards before you 
reach a house on the left. The road to the cemetery is actually a mowed area 
where the road used to be. The blue arrow above points to a cemetery that has no 
stones. It is fenced separately and mowed but has no visible stones. <br>

This aerial map shows the Maclin-Aymett Ccemetery just before you reach the first house on the 
left. I believe another cemetery, the Aymett Cemetery to be behind that house on the 
left 100 yards east of this cemetery, but I have not been there. I do think it 
is in this area sandwiched between Old Hwy 64 and the new Highway 64. <br>
