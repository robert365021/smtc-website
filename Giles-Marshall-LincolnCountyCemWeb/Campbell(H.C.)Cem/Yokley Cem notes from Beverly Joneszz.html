<DIV>HERE IS TERINA'S REPLY:<BR>I don't mind sharing what I have with Wayne. I 
can do the names, probably dates, but it would take another visit to read some 
of the fine inscriptions. It is hard to believe that it's not listed. Most of 
these folks were prominent figures in Campbellsville history or relatives of 
such.<BR><BR>This cemetery is on your right if you're heading north to 
Columbia.<BR>You can see it from Hwy. 245, but you have to turn right onto Smith 
Hollow Rd. Then it will be on your left up on the hilltop. It sits in a patch of 
trees, everything else around it is pasture.<BR><BR>I'm not sure who the land 
owner is. I'm a country girl, so I just went right through the electric cattle 
fence, climbed up the hill and went right in. Kinda glad I did, seems like the 
owners may have an issue with people nosing around up there if they are doing 
things they know people won't appreciate. Needless to say I was ticked off when 
I saw the state of things. Overgrowth is one thing, unnecessary destruction is 
another.<BR>By the way, it IS fenced, but a fence doesn't do any good with the 
gate left wide open.<BR>It does make a person mad enough to sue. : ) 
<BR><BR>Anyway, I'll work on this during the holidays when I will have some time 
to sit and concentrate. I have a big list of genealogy related things that I 
want to get finished up and this is one of them. <BR>Hope you have a Merry 
Christmas!<BR>Terina</DIV>

<DIV>How does a cemetery that large not get on the USGS mapping survey. They say 
it may have something to do with permission from the land owner?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If I visit it the whole world will then know where it is.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It is a big one probably larger than the Hannah Cem. Something around a 100 
stones. How does a farmer get away with abusing a cemetery that large and with 
stone that recent. Ya'll outa go in and sue the owner&nbsp;and get a right of 
way with it being that large then fence it. If you will do that I will go there 
and help restore the stones upright.</DIV>

  <DIV>Yokley cemetery&nbsp;- at Hwy 245 (Campbellsville Pike) and Smith Hollow 
  Road. It's up on a hill and is visible from Hwy 245. It's in the middle of a 
  farm property/cattle pasture, but is fenced around the cemetery. Lots of 
  graves in it.<BR>I took pictures of as many as I could. Some were tipped over 
  and too heavy to lift, and some were unmarked or marked with just a simple 
  stone. It didn't have a sign or anything on the gate. There are some other 
  families buried there as well.</DIV>

  <DIV>Terina Boyd, who provided the photo of the stone 
  for Emma Hayes, had this to say about Yokley Cemetery:</DIV>
  <DIV>
  <DIV style="WIDTH: 477px" class=CurrentMessage>
  <DIV>I could not get every grave as some were tipped over and too heavy to 
  lift and see who was on the stone. Cattle have been in the cemetery and have 
  tipped over/damaged several stones and it is somewhat grown up with grass and 
  weeds. Whoever owns the farm has also been dragging their dead cows into the 
  cemetery to rot, lots of remains scattered around. There was a fairly "fresh" 
  one in there when I went in, so I didn't stay in there as long as I would 
  like.<BR>There were a few "box tombs" that were very worn or were damaged. 
  Some I could read, and some not.<BR>There were some unmarked graves or graves 
  with just a plain rock and no name.<BR>So I just took as many pictures as I 
  could. <BR>Needless to say, there are definitely a few more graves that still 
  need to be identified in that cemetery. May have to go back in there 
  again.<BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Beverly again.&nbsp; Maybe you should see what Terina has already 
  shot.&nbsp; I'm glad to ask her, or just to ask what kind of dogs and people 
  she encountered. (I only know about the cows.)&nbsp; I've only seen one of her 
  pictures from Yokley Cemetery:</DIV></DIV></DIV></FONT></DIV></DIV><SPAN     contentEditable=false><SPAN style="DISPLAY: block"     layoutEmptyTextWellFont="Tahoma" xmlns:canvas="canvas-namespace-id"><SPAN     style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15px; HEIGHT: 19px; OVERFLOW: visible"></SPAN><SPAN     style="DISPLAY: inline-block; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 25px; HEIGHT: 241px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: top; OVERFLOW: visible; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px">
