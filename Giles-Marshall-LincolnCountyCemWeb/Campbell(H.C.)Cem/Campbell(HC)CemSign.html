The Campbell-Rittenberry originally was called the Hamilton
Crockett Campbell Cemetery after the eldest progenitor here. That is the name of
this cemetery in the Giles County Historical Society Book. Someone later decided
to name it after the most prevalent surnames interred in this cemetery.<br>

Entrance into the cemetery marked with decorative hand made stones showing
someone's special thoughts and care of this cemetery and its ancestral
inhabitants. In the background we see the bases of the giant Grain Silos that so
easily mark the location of this burial ground.<br>
