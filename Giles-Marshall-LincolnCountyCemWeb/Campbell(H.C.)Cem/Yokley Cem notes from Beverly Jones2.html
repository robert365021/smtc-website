<DIV>That's great!&nbsp; Congratulations!</DIV>
<DIV>I wonder if Sarah Elizabeth Yokley (1858-1936) 
could be the stone "matching" the Sophronia Yokley stone.&nbsp; Sophronia 
Yokley's dates were 1855-1931,</DIV>
<DIV>and the two sisters were unmarried (to the best 
of my knowledge) with close birth and death years.</DIV>
<DIV>I did not get to Yokley or Sam Yokley Cemeteries 
when I visited.&nbsp; I did get to Morristown Cemetery where I photographed the 
gravemarker of Susannah Tacker Morris (1770-1840).</DIV>
<DIV>There are only five graves at Morristown, and my 
picture is not great.&nbsp; I was totally lost when we arrived there, so don't 
ask <U>me</U> for directions!</DIV>
<DIV>I will share my photo, if you want to assess it 
for yourself.</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks again!</DIV>
<DIV>Beverly</DIV>

<DIV>Greetings Beverly</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Had a successful day yesterday visiting and photographing several 
cemeteries around Campbellsville. These are the ones.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>Yokley Cemetery (100+ stones&nbsp;and not on any mapping to show it 
exist.)</DIV>
<DIV>Campbell-Rittenberry Cem (20+ stones, Campbellsville)</DIV>
<DIV>Campbellsville Cem - (about 400 stones, finished about 1/2 of it) Will 
return later for completion.)</DIV>
<DIV>Wilkerson Cem (10 stones)</DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Don't tell Terina&nbsp;I went there yet as I want her to send the photos 
she has and we can get the best of both photos. I did cover everything including 
the box tombs, but&nbsp; there were two&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Yokley 
memorials&nbsp;tumbled on their face with&nbsp;the inscription&nbsp;down toward 
the ground and unmovable by me.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Was this the case on your visit? Did you get the photos?</DIV>
<DIV>Also made a photo from the road of the Sam Yokley Cem but not a close up. I 
am counting on Terina's photos there. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Dead cow is still there.&nbsp;Shooooey!. Got photos of this and&nbsp;might 
use it against the owner. One stone is within 10 yards of the carcass and that 
was the photo of the century as I see it. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Saw the graves of my great aunt, hubby &amp;&nbsp;deceased children. The 
Vick's.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One of the stones I missed was Jacob Yokley. Hope there is a surviving 
inscription somewhere for that. Another was near Sophrinia Yokley and just like 
her stone so maybe her sister or spouse.&nbsp;</DIV>

  <DIV><FONT face=Calibri>The photo taken by Terina Boyd that I sent you is from 
  the Sam Yokley Cemetery (which is not Yokley Cemetery, nor Hannah-Yokley 
  Cemetery).</DIV>
  <DIV>Mea culpa.&nbsp; That's why it looks so neat and 
  trim.&nbsp; There are only&nbsp;five burials in Sam Yokley 
  Cemetery.</DIV>
  <DIV>Terina DID also&nbsp;photograph the much larger and 
  cow-troubled Yokley Cemetery.</DIV>
  <DIV>I just sent you the wrong photograph, and figured I'd 
  better clarify before more confusion was created.</DIV>
