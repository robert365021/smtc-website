<DIV>Susanah Morris born 28 Oct 1770 (her first child  
was&nbsp;born 1791. She died 19 Sep  
1840, according to what I have.</DIV> 
<DIV>Her husband Isaac Morris Sr. is not buried  
there-----he's interred at&nbsp;Isaac Morris Cemetery in Giles according to what  
I found.&nbsp; I have not been to that cemetery.</DIV> 
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>The mother&nbsp;with infant is Mary Sophronia  
Yokley 6 (maybe 8)&nbsp;Dec 1817 - 15 Oct 1851.&nbsp; The date I have on the  
infant is 15 Oct 1851.</DIV> 
<DIV><br>
  Her husband was Daniel Americus "Mack" Alexander,  
11 Sep 1811 - 10 Nov 1882.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess Mary Sophronia went by Sophronia,  
because that is how the cemetery book has her.&nbsp; </DIV> 
<DIV>She was the  
daughter of Andrew D. Yokley and Delia Morris Yokley.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The Revolutionary War soldier is David  
Abernathy----but I'm just quoting the cemetery book on that point.</DIV> 
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm so glad the photo works and that you can  
enhance it.&nbsp; And I'm so glad you shot Yokley Cemetery----it is an important  
one for the Campbellsville history!</DIV>

<DIV>Morristown photo of Susanah Morris is fine compared to some I get. I can  
even read it if I alter it, by&nbsp;using graphics enhancement.</DIV> 
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In memory of SUSANAH MORRIS, Born October 28th 1770, Died Sept&nbsp;  
_7th?&nbsp; 1840.&nbsp;(wife of Isaac Morris, Sr) </DIV> 
<DIV>Where is Isaac Sr.'s&nbsp;grave? Is it suppose to be nearby? Instructions 
are terrible.&nbsp;"Hwy 64W&nbsp;right to Cambpellsville Road" gets one within 
20 miles.&nbsp;Considering I have not been able to find cemeteries with 40 feet 
of me because of thick brush that is useless. OK! I get carried away about 
instructions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If we post the Morristown Cem we should post&nbsp;the single 
listing&nbsp;one of her husband too even without finding it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Already lost an E-mail&nbsp;answering your queries a while ago&nbsp;I 
will&nbsp;make this one short. Computer is acting up badly today.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I think short is better in Cemetery names First surname there is the usual 
best way to name one.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yes and I photographed all the fieldstones just as if they were memorials. 
Mary Bob will add them at the end of the listing as Unknown souls. My Vick kin 
had them lined up to the east of there graves five deep and another 
infant&nbsp;grave there in front.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You will be pleased&nbsp;at the Yokley Cemetery photos as I actually am 
getter better after 40,000 photos. I now use a method of cleaning that makes the 
inscription quite readable with white chalk and sanding blocks that sand the 
chalk&nbsp;into the surface clearing the lichens from the stone assuming the old 
kind of Limestone memorials. It actually restore the surface and I do not bear 
down just light circular motions. The new granite stones&nbsp;I do nothing too. 
Recently found a supplier of white chalk at 30 cents per stick 1" X 4" which 
helps. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>One box tomb in Yokley Cemetery with Alexander as a surname has a lady and 
her infant son whereby she died at about the time of&nbsp;childbirth. Those are 
always tough to take. Got sunshine shadows on it complicating the&nbsp; reading. 
</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Says something like:</DIV>
<DIV>1. "Sacred to the memory of Sophrona, &amp; her infant. Consort &amp; son 
of D.A. Alexander (probably the Rev War soldier). Daughter of Andrew &amp; Delia 
Yokley, who was born Oct 18th (1831?)/(1851?)/(1821?) Aged 33 years 10 months 
&amp; 8 days. Her illness _ _ _ _ _ _? . Finish later.</DIV>
<DIV>2. Another says Mary Claiborne Rainey&nbsp;was born in Pittsylvania Co VA. 
1797, etc.</DIV>
<DIV>3. A rev War soldier David Alexander is there too.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Just an fascinating&nbsp;cemetery. Really&nbsp;there are two mystery stones 
with inscriptions face down that need transcriptions. We will see how it goes if 
we get no satisfaction maybe I will pull out the old winch &amp; chain and 
padded rubber pads and wag all that&nbsp;up the hill.</DIV>

  <DIV>Susanah Tacker Morris</DIV>
  <DIV>Morristown Cemetery</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My vague memory doesn't 
  include&nbsp;Morristown cemetery being on a hill.&nbsp; I think we parked on 
  the road immediately adjacent to the cemetery.</DIV>
  <DIV>I will ask my cousin Porter Hannah where it is and how 
  to get there.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I THINK the 
  Campbell-Rittenberry cemetery is on the land of Mark Dunavant, who is the 
  person I have recently written to about the </DIV>
  <DIV>Margaret Hannah mystery.&nbsp; Mark and I are related 
  through the Hannahs and the Campbells. He's a walking encyclopedia of local 
  history, and very entertaining.</DIV>
  <DIV>The name for Campbell-Rittenberry cemetery in the 
  cemetery book is H.C. Campbell Cemetery, but I started using 
  Campbell-Rittenberry because of the sign </DIV>
  <DIV>on the gate.&nbsp; You could&nbsp;be a 
  trendsetter&nbsp;if you add West!&nbsp; I read about the Rittenberrys 
  recently.&nbsp; They all lived in Alabama and seem like 
remarkable</DIV>
  <DIV>people.&nbsp; I ended up wondering why they were 
  buried in Giles County, Tennessee.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sure wish I had had a 
  bigger vision of what I was doing in 2002.&nbsp; I could have photographed all 
  five graves at Morristown.&nbsp; I was a beginner.</DIV>
  <DIV>I'm going to give another shot at figuring out who the 
  mystery grave might be, but your process of elimination will be the key.&nbsp; 
  Did you find a lot</DIV>
  <DIV>of field stones in Yokley Cemetery&nbsp;like Terina 
  did?&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Dunavant may be the 
  go-to person about the sorry condition of Yokley Cemetery.&nbsp; I think I 
  mentioned it in my letter.&nbsp; Being a local landowner,</DIV>
  <DIV>he may have standing to get something done about it 
  (without having to sue----cheaper).</DIV>
  <DIV>Later...</DIV>
