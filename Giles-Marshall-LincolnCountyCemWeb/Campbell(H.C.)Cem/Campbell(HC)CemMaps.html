  <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>CAMPBELL (Hamilton Crockett)
CEMETERY,
(Campbellsville, west side) GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE&nbsp;<br>
  <img border="0" src="Campbell(HC)CemRd.jpg" width="1018" height="613"><br>
  Location: Highway 64 West, right onto Campbellsville Road (Hwy 166). Go thru
  Campbellsville and turn left on Dunivant Rd. After permission from Mr.
  Dunivant turn left again into the field road that goes left of the grain silos
  (big tanks). The cemetery is just past the grain silos on the left about 50
  yards northwest of the last tank.&nbsp;<br>
  This cemetery location GPS coordinates was plotted by Wayne
  Austin using MS Streets &amp; Trips. It is not actually placed on
  this map. The United States Geological Survey omitted this cemetery from the mapping
  survey leaving me no choice but to improvise.<br>

  From this Aerial view we see the trees just northwest which surround the
  cemetery with the yellow pointers showing the spot. The North/South white line
  thru town is Hwy 166.<br>
  The Longitude &amp; Latitude of
  this cemetery as calculated using MS Streets &amp; Trips is 35.33730
  degrees North X 87.13339 degrees West with a small degree of error mostly in
  the north/south calculation. This cemetery was not found on any map that I am
  familiar with and thus all the above map placements is by Wayne Austin. The
  yellow pointer points out the cemetery.&nbsp;We believe the accuracy is
  sufficient since this is lovely and a well maintained cemetery.<br>
