<p align="center"><b>CAMPBELL (H.C.) CEMETERY,
(Campbellsville, west side) GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE&nbsp;<br>
</b><b>
<img border="0" src="1970w-1.JPG" width="955" height="266"><br>
<font color="#000080">In this area photo we can see most of
the upright memorials of the Campbell-Rittenberry Cemetery or also called
Campbell (Hamilton Crockett) Cemetery after Hamilton Crockett Campbell, 1786 -
1853. His memorial sits back to our right of the last tree with the straight
tree trunk with a limb overhanging. This is in the center of the photo. Many of the Rittenberrry stones
on our left are small and close to
the ground level. They are subject to being overlooked.<br>
The area to the far right and back is the row where the
Morris graves are located. That is behind that large dark green Cedar Tree with
the big trunk. To the front of
that and still in the right area of the photo is the Campbell family graves. The
big memorial in the front and center belongs to Hamilton Crockett &amp; Forrest
Yokley Campbell. In the left of the photo is
the Rittenberry memorials. Many of them cannot be seen. They are flat stones even with the
ground with long border stones. In the far back row next to the fence in the left area of the photo are
the West family memorials. The Carrie Baker stone cannot be seen here. It is off
of the photo on our right next row, first stone in front part of the cemetery.<br>
