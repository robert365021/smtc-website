<DIV>Morristown Cemetery</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My vague memory doesn't 
include&nbsp;Morristown cemetery being on a hill.&nbsp; I think we parked on the 
road immediately adjacent to the cemetery.</DIV>
<DIV>I will ask my cousin Porter Hannah where it is and how 
to get there.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I THINK the 
Campbell-Rittenberry cemetery is on the land of Mark Dunavant, who is the person 
I have recently written to about the </DIV>
<DIV>Margaret Hannah mystery.&nbsp; Mark and I are related 
through the Hannahs and the Campbells. He's a walking encyclopedia of local 
history, and very entertaining.</DIV>
<DIV>The name for Campbell-Rittenberry cemetery in the 
cemetery book is H.C. Campbell Cemetery, but I started using 
Campbell-Rittenberry because of the sign </DIV>
<DIV>on the gate.&nbsp; You could&nbsp;be a 
trendsetter&nbsp;if you add West!&nbsp; I read about the Rittenberrys 
recently.&nbsp; They all lived in Alabama and seem like remarkable</DIV>
<DIV>people.&nbsp; I ended up wondering why they were buried 
in Giles County, Tennessee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sure wish I had had a bigger 
vision of what I was doing in 2002.&nbsp; I could have photographed all five 
graves at Morristown.&nbsp; I was a beginner.</DIV>
<DIV>I'm going to give another shot at figuring out who the 
mystery grave might be, but your process of elimination will be the key.&nbsp; 
Did you find a lot</DIV>
<DIV>of field stones in Yokley Cemetery&nbsp;like Terina 
did?&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Dunavant may be the go-to 
person about the sorry condition of Yokley Cemetery.&nbsp; I think I mentioned 
it in my letter.&nbsp; Being a local landowner,</DIV>
<DIV>he may have standing to get something done about it 
(without having to sue----cheaper).</DIV>
<DIV>Later...</DIV>
