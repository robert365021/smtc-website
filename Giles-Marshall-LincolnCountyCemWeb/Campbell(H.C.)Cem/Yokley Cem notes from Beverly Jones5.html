<DIV>There are two other historic notes I failed to mention on the stones in 
Yokley Cemetery. There is a Franklin A., son of Andrew &amp; Delia Yokley who 
died in 1852 at the&nbsp;age of 21. He professed religion at the Popular Grove 
Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Well to me (and it has been my 
experience)&nbsp;this means this cemetery was probably founded by the Cumberland 
Presbyterians and that there as a church nearby with that name. Now try to find 
that bit of history in the cemetery book. I doubt if they even read it on the 
stone. Photo #1859. The church may have sat down where that house is 
now.&nbsp;Have any knowledge of that? Mary Bob will love translating that long 
poet inscription. Challenge now is to find some history on that old 
church.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Another note on a stone&nbsp;was in the cemetery book.&nbsp;A Civil War 
soldier David G. Alexander was wounded at the battle of Resaca, Ga. 15 May 1864 
and died 6 Jun 1864. Photo #1710.</DIV>

  <DIV><FONT face=Calibri>I think the "matching" but toppled headstone might be 
  Andrew Yokley (sometimes called Geon----the nicknames or middle names are 
  confusing) 1859-1917.</DIV>
  <DIV>This was one of the names blocked by your fingers in 
  the picture of page 530 from the cemetery book, but the visible dates match my 
  family tree information. </DIV>
  <DIV>The two matching stones are for&nbsp;children of Jacob Yokley &amp; Almanza Ann Abernathy, so 
  the third stone is likely also to be their child.&nbsp; It looks like seven of 
  their </DIV>
  <DIV>children are buried at Yokley Cemetery.&nbsp; Terina 
  has photos of six of those stones----all but Andrew 
  "Geon" Yokley.&nbsp; What do you think?</DIV>
