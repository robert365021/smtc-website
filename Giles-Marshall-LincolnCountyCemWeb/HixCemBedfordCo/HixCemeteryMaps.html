This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Hix Cemetery on what is termed Crooked 
Run Road. This road is now called Amos Gamble Road.&nbsp;<br>

Location: Go south from Shelbyville on Hwy 231 to New Center Church Road and 
turn east or left. Go about 2 miles and turn south (right) on Amos Gamble Road. 
From there - there is a field road back into the area of the cemetery, but a better way is to get local 
help from that point, given how far back off the road this little cemetery is 
located and the hazards one would need to cross (Streams &amp; Fences). Some notes though: The cemetery is located on the south facing edge of 
a forest. The Word Cemetery is also located close to here and can be visited at 
the same time.&nbsp; <br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery in the edge of the tree line. I think it is 
located along the south side of an old pioneer road bed under the trees. Long 
time resident Mr. 
Hasty took me to visit this and the Word Cemetery otherwise I would not have 
gone there. One must find away across the Crooked Creek shown as a green tree 
line running parallel to the Amos Gamble Road and more than one cattle gap. Well I could now use this map to 
find the cemetery on foot, but not so sure I could drive there. <br>
