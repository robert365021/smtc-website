When I returned back home and tried to find this cemetery on the Google 
maps I was amazed that nothing looked like that clump of trees shown here. I thought 
it was 
jutting out from the woodland southwest and the stones inside facing east/west I 
recall climbing the hill and&nbsp; examining several clumps of long trees with 
outcropping piles of rocks in my efforts to locate this place. There were at 
least two of those Rock piles as I went up the slope, whereas Mr. John Sorrells 
scanned (walked) back and forth in his efforts also to find the cemetery. We 
then met closer to the top of the hill and came out into the open field and he 
went straight to the clump of trees having found this place. This is a photo of 
the cemetery from down in the field from there.<br>
The clump is connected to the woodland to the north east side (I think) and juts 
out into the field (it seems to me southwestward). The rock wall inside the 
trees backs up to the woodland and is normal for a cemetery of this size. 
However All this does not stand out on google maps so maybe I have the GPS 
right. If the given coordinates are incorrect then try one of these: N 35.35320 W 
86.60601 or N 35.35293 W 86.60550 or N 35.35260 X W 86.60208 or N 35.35282 X W 
86.60548. <br>
<font color="#800000" size="2">Jason Dewayne Mathena &quot;JayDee&quot; the little boy shown 
holding his empty water bottle is 9 years old and 
loved to get into the photos and did so here. He is a Sorrells descendent 
and may also descend from the Elzey's. Was a great nephew of John Sorrells shown in the photo on the Wm Sorrells Cemetery 
and in some of the photos here. Very smart kid. When we were about half way up 
the hill and trying to find this cemetery he promptly declared &quot;I know where 
that is. It is up near the top of the hill, been there on my four wheeler&quot;</font><br>

Location: From Fayetteville go north many miles on Highway 231 to Chestnut Ridge 
and turn left on Hwy 129 (Chestnut Ridge/Petersburg Rd). Follow that about 3 
miles and turn right (north) on Bledsoe Road and go something under three miles 
and turn left on Hannah Gap Road. The Hannah Gap Baptist Church is on your right 
just before you turn left. Follow Hannah Gap Road which becomes Sorrells Road 
after crossing into Marshall County for 2+ miles and find the JE Sorrells 
Cemetery on the left side of the road. Then turn around and go 100 yards back 
and park on the south side of the road and there should be an opening into the 
field leading up the slope maybe to the cemetery.<br>

From this google image we see surviving parts of an old home which shows the 
foundation rocks and the chimney. This sits back in the field south east of the 
JE Sorrells Cemetery about 150 yards. This home may have belonged to the Elzey family which has a family 
graveyard another 200 yards up the hill to the southeast.<br>
