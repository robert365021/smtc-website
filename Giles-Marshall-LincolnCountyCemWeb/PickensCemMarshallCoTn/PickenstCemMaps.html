From Exit 27, I-65 exit and go west toward Lynnville less than a mile 
and 1/2 
and turn north (right) on Mooresville Rd. Follow that as it snakes around for abt 3 miles and the cemetery is across the road from a new home upon a 
hill, 
in a cane thicket, about 100 yards up the hill, east of the road. Position 
yourself on the road at the south corner of the new home and climb east up the 
hill and you will find the cemetery. I caution everyone to go here only with good 
intentions. Bad intentions will be met with swift justice by the local people 
who will quietly question anyone's intentions for visiting a cemetery such as 
this.<br>
