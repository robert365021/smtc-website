This map shows the Petty Cemetery just 1.4 miles north on Cook Hollow Road just
past the junction of a farm road on the right. With this map we also see the GPS
Coordinates Latitude and Longitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><br>

</b>Location: Highway 64 West from Pulaski.&nbsp; Turn (North) right into
Campbellsville Road. Go several miles and turn right into Minnow Branch Road,
bear left on Cook Hollow Road shown on some maps as Petty Hollow Rd. Go about
1.4 miles and the cemetery is on right just past a farm road. It it inside a
chain link fence on the bank of the road.<b><br>

This aerial view shows the cemetery on the right of Petty Hollow Road upon a
bank. The yellow arrow points out the farm road by Google mapping, but it is
drawn too far south and does not curve enough so the above graphic spans out across the forest, but at least we see the cemetery in a small clearing above
the road inside a chain link fence.<br>
