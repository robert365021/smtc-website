<b>WILSON, Bethshery, 30 Mar 1796 - 6 Jun 1841, wife of Mathew Wilson. 
(photo added 3 Sep 2015)</b><br>
<b>The yellow arrow (1st photo above) points out this very old gothic style monument </b>
<b>SACRED To the 
memory of BETHSHERY, wife of MATHEW WILSON, Born March 30, 1796 Died June 6, 
1841. Wonder where Mathew 
Wilson is buried. The other Mathew Wilson in this listing was too young, perhaps 
a son (b. 1826) to be Bethshery's (b. 1796's) husband.<br>
Last photo made with a Cannon telephoto lens thru the iron fence.<br>
