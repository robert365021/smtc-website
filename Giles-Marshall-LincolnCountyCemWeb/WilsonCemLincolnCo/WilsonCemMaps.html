This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Wilson Cemetery.
The nearest major town is actually Fayetteville Tennessee about 7 miles west as a crow flies.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="WilsonCemRd.jpg" width="1600" height="781"><br>
Location: Go west from Fayetteville about 4 miles on Highway 64 to Old Bethel 
Road and turn left or South. Follow that road south until it dead ends into 
Gunter Hollow Road (next to Bethel Cemetery). Turn right (or west) on Gunter 
Hollow Road and go about 1 and 1/2 miles and turn right into Hopper Road. Go 
about 500 yards to the gate to the cemetery on your left. You will see the 
cemetery out in the field under round shaped grove of trees. Get permission and 
a key to cross the locked gate of this 7 foot iron fence. In fact there are 
about 3 gates to cross from the road. The gate into the field from the road, the 
gate into the cemetery area put there by the land owner and the main gate 
recently added across the 7' iron fence.&nbsp; Do not go to this cemetery 
without a key to the gate. If you&nbsp; do you will waste your time on the 7 
foot iron is not accessible with the key to the cemetery.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery out in a field to the south of Hopper Road 
marked with a red check. 
Today this is a major farming operation, so consider how you can avoid 
disturbing that upon your visit. 
The Iron fence was erected in 2006 by Don Wyatt and he is the contact for access 
to this cemetery. This cemetery is well kept except the usual monument repairs 
need to be done such as plundered monuments lying on the ground.<br>
