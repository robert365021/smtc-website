south on Hwy 31 14+ miles to Hardy Road and turn left. Climb up the hill and 
dead end into Bunker Hill/Old Stage Coach Road, and turn right. Follow that for a 
about 1 1/2 miles passing King road on your right. Go to the next road turning 
north (left) into that and crossing the bridge. Follow that Rd until it bends back to the 
right. With permission park there. Crawl under or over the fences 
without getting shocked or damaging the fences or disturbing the livestock. From 
there the 
cemetery is north of you up the slope further beyond a large treed lot. It is located in a small cedar and hackberry thicket under a fallen rock wall as 
seen in the below photo.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
