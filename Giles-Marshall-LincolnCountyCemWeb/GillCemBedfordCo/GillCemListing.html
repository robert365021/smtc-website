			This Cemetery is located on part of the old James McKissick North 
			Carolina Land Grant that was later purchased by George Waite, who 
			sold a part of it to W. W. Gill. <br>
			The Alexander &amp; Mary Gill monuments could be the very old type that 
			perished. I do not believe their inscription were on the back side 
			of the tall family monument. See #2316. <br>
			Here is my assessment of what was found on this monument: East side: <i>In memory of the 
			W.W. Gill Family </i>&nbsp;|<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>West Side:<i>
			</i>&nbsp;(Nothing-Can be seen on a blow up of Photo #2316, not 
			visible on this site). <i>&nbsp;</i>| North Side:<i>&nbsp; 
			We all do fade as a leaf. <br>
			</i>South Side:<i>&nbsp; (</i>An epithet which 
			I missed photographing,&nbsp; it is long &amp; of a poetic nature. 
			Slightly visible in #2305). Maybe their tombstone is not here 
			and they are interred in unmarked graves or maybe their tombstone 
			fell and sunk into the ground. The third possibility is that their 
			tombstone and grave are located somewhere else on their place. The 
			third possibility is discounted by the knowledge that this graveyard 
			was founded at least as early as 1849 when the child Martha died. 
			This is before Alexander and Mary died. </font></p>
