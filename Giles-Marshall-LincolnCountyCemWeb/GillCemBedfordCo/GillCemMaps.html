  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville Tennessee go north 
		on Hwy 231 thru up into and thru Moore County and the Chestnut Ridge and 
		on into Bedford County. Pass Blue stocking Hollow Road on the left and 
		go another mile and turn right into the Hawthorne Hill Road and go a few 
		hundred yards and the cemetery is on your right inside a high rock wall 
		with the entrance gate from inside the south side of the rock wall.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery more clearly. At the time of 
		this photo it was under the trees. The trees have since been cleared. There is 
		minimal parking between the road and the Cemetery wall. If you are 
		not adept enough to scale a 4 high by 2 feet thick rock wall considering 
		the risk, then you will need permission from the landowner to go around 
		to the south entrance of the enclosure to the steel gate. However, you 
		could use a ladder on both sides to scale the wall, but please be 
		careful. The rock wall is aging and brittle and is in danger of falling.</font></b><br>
