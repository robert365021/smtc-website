</font><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080" size="2">This cemetery is 
overshadowed by Clump of Hackberry Trees out in the field. The tree has grown to 
such an extent it now has the graves under and inside the trunk of the tree. The 
Martin Industries truck trailer that is nearby this spot today is behind the 
trees in the right of this photo. <br>
Oddly Martin Industries was a company in my past. I worked for them as a 
Controller of their Huntsville location. After I left seeking greener pastures 
they went down fast declaring complete bankruptcy within a couple of years. The 
courts liquidated the assets and set in motion an effort that completely 
demolished the corporate office in Florence Alabama. The Huntsville plant was 
bought up and converted into a graphic design company. Millions of dollars of 
manufacturing equipment were sold off for scrap. What a shame. That company was just 
another of Americas great old manufacturing companies that was demolished in the 
loss of millions of manufacturing jobs to oversees and lack of management. 
Someday I will write up my opinion of the &quot;whys&quot; of all that but Donald Trump is 
onto the problem. It is just that they are now playing with fire trying to 
correct the problem this late.</font></b></p>
