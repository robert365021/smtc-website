</b><b>Location: Go 
east out old Hwy 15 aka Beech Hill Rd several miles to the Friendship Church 
Community. When you see a large Trailer trailer with a Martin Industries sign 
you have just passed this little cemetery. 
TAs stated the cemetery is just back from that a couple of hundred yards and about 30 yards 
from the road on the left (north) under and inside a clump of hackberry trees is the 
cemetery. The cemetery is being swallowed up by the clumping of several tree trunks.</b><b><br>

The Tree out in the field has the graves under and inside the trunk and the 
Martin Trailer that marks this spot today is behind the trees in the right of 
this photo.<br>
