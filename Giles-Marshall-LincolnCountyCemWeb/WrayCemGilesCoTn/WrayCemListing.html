have it, but the photo is clear enough that you can draw your own conclusions.</b>

</font>Many field stones. This is a big area,&nbsp; The 
landowner (farmers) has avoided tilling a large area of maybe two thirds of an 
acres, which may include many more graves. <br>
<br>
This past Sunday afternoon, I walked the south bank of the Elk River at Kelly 
Creek (south of present-day Wheelerton), in Giles County right on the Lincoln 
County line. I looking for evidence of a small community that once thrived there 
at the old Salt House, a local goods building operated by John McCracken about 
1810. This is also the location for the crossing of the old McCutcheon Trace 
(Shoemaker's Ferry) and the ancient Richland Creek Road.<br>
<br>
My cursory effort yielded an old road, and an unlisted cemetery&nbsp; (Rachael 
Wray Cem) at the coordinates 35.082753,-86.855251<br>
<br>
The only stone I was able to read was for Rachel Wray, aged 20, who died in 
1830. I noticed numerous, probably dozens of old unmarked graves in that grove a 
trees. Do you have any information for a grave at that location?<br>
<br>
This may have been a burial ground also used by native American Indians as noted 
in the mounding up of the cemetery. That would be perhaps well before Europeans 
moved into the area. the cemetery is in the midst of a mildly conspicuous, 
roundish rise (maybe five feet?) in the landscape, covered in large, beautiful 
trees, encompassed about 1 acre. I can't help but think the rise may have been a 
mound: the edges of the field around the trees are lower, and fills up when it 
rains. <br>
<br>
It could be that the adjacent Kelly's Creek carved its way around a particularly 
stubborn jumble of rocks, or Indians scooped the dirt to make a mound. Can't 
tell yet. The property owner, forbids anyone from collecting arrowhead and other 
Indian artifacts in the field. Notice the Carved Indian artifact lying on the 
lower RH corner of Rachel Wray's stone As I was walking across the uncultivated 
field, I found this (Animal) skinning flint or aborted arrowhead. And I left it 
with the stone in keeping with the instructions of the landowner.<br>

<p>Historical notes by David: This 
past weekend I was specifically looking for evidence of the McCutcheon Trace, 
the ancient Richland Creek Road, and the Salt House before I found the cemetery. 
Sure enough the road surfaces are clearly visible along much of their tracks, 
but no Salt House yet. When the water level goes down on the Elk River the 
crossing will be much easier to estimate.<br>
<br>
The Tree lined Row crossing north of the Wray Cemetery in a straight east/west 
line is an old road that became known as the &quot;Upper Pulaski Road&quot;. Today it 
includes at least one tall barbed wire fence and two columns of trees, mostly 
large. In between the trees is the old sunken road. The road was commissioned by 
Lincoln County and routed/built by local citizens in early times. The intention 
was to develop the best trade route from the Salt House to the Alabama state 
line, for easier access to and from Huntsville, Alabama.<br>
<br>
Before the railroad was constructed about 1915-1920, what is now called Eagan 
Cemetery Road continued straight almost to the Elk River, then dog-legged to the 
left toward Shoemaker's Ferry, the MaCutcheon Trace and the Salt House, a 
trading post that was first built to store and sell salt from a flatboat that 
couldn't pass upstream beyond the shallows adjacent to the ferry. <br>
<br>
For years a fellow by the name of McCracken operated the salt house. I think he 
was also a postmaster, as a post office inhabited the place from about 1813 to 
1823.</p>
<p>I'll be going (north) across the Elk River soon to climb Latitude Hill, in 
search of (survey) markings from 1783 to 1807. I seriously doubt there will be 
any. Very few folks know there's a &quot;Latitude Hill&quot; where the initial surveys 
were made for the southern boundary of Tennessee. I'll also look for (the lost) 
Young Cemetery when I go over there.&nbsp; [D.W.]</p>
