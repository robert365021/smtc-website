From Lewisburg go east on west Commerce St and turn left onto Mooresville Hwy 373. Go almost 
under I-65 and turn south on Globe Road. Pass by the Marsh Cemetery far off the 
road on your left and the Houston Cemetery on your right a couple hundred yards 
from the road. Merge onto Kincaid Road after a couple of miles on Globe Road and 
go a few hundred yards and the cemetery is on the bank of the road on the right.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery marked with a red check next to the road under a stand of trees. It 
was fenced and maintained when I was there.<br>
