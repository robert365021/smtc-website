We are looking due west across the cemetery from
the eastern edge. For all nut heads out there that
is the headlights of an approaching car in the thick of&nbsp;that shrubbery and not a spook.&nbsp;<br>

This view looks northwest&nbsp; out over part of the cemetery. We can see across
the road upon the bank where <br>
the black section is located. It is much smaller than the main white section and
his fewer marked stones. The tall moss covered stone belongs the Coffey family
who migrated here from Campbell Station in Maury County, but did not stay.
Coffey may have been a minister at this church for a time. They are mostly all buried back
where their roots are in Campbell Station.</p>
