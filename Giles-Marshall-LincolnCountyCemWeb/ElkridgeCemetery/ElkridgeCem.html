There was at one time a church on the north side of the road called Elkridge
Presbyterian Church of the old persuasion. While it formed the very foundation
of the religious movements for early settlers who came here in 1807 from the
Carolina's there is no evidence of its existence today, except for the old
graveyard across the road on the south side. The Shields, Crockett's, Montgomery's,
King's
and others who were the early founders of this community known as Elkridge or
Roberson Fork were
instrumental in founding this church and burial grounds along the Roberson Fork
branch long before roads were cut thru here.&nbsp; Goodspeed's &quot;History of
Giles County Tennessee&quot; mentioned that they came here from North Carolina
in 1807.&nbsp;<br>
A 4 year old boy by the name of Washington K. Shields was the first person
buried here that was given
an inscribed stone with the following: &quot;Sacred to the Memory of Washington
K. Shields who was born Oct 11th 1807 A.D. and departed this life July 16th A.D.
1814, aged 4 years &amp; 9 months and 25 days&quot;&nbsp;<br>
 Descendents who knew the location of the old Samuel Montgomery grave passed the information down and
later generations installed the military marker commemorating this old
Revolutionary Soldier who was born in 1732 and died during 1808.&nbsp;I
seriously doubt if there was a formal memorial for him there before that.<br>
Judging from the age of this cemetery and the way it is laid out the first
burials here were mostly without markers and it was into the 1830s before
markers were used by all but a few fortunate souls.<br>
