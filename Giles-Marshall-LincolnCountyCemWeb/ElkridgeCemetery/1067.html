COCHRAN, J. B., 16 Apr 1839 - (no date), Co G. 53rd Infntry, (Confederate States
Army, he is likely a war casualty and would have died between 1861 and 1865.).&nbsp;<br>
Mr. Cochran was probably a war casualty since no date was provided. This could
mean the relatives were not knowledgeable as to when he died in the war. Mr.
Cochran may not lie here but somewhere in a mass battle grave. (anyone with
proof out there?)</b><center><b><i><br>
