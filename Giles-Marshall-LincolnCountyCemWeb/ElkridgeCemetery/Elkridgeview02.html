This is a view looking southwest over the old
part of the cemetery. We are looking at the memorials of the Montgomery's
Crockett's, Shields, King, Ausban, Thompson, Coffey, Kerr, James &amp; many
others. Many represent families that once lived here and death from infectious
diseases nearly wiped them out so they moved on to other places after losing a
wife or a child or several children.<br>

This view looks west out over the cemetery panning just to our right compared to
the above photo. Highway 129 lies to our right and Roberson Fork Creek is on our
left.&nbsp; Further left we see just the tip of a chain of hills. On our right a
couple of miles or so north lies the Elk Ridge. Elk Ridge is a chain of hills
which forms a ridge spanning between the southern Maury County &amp; Northern
Giles County line.</p>
