We are standing in the eastern part of the old
section of the cemetery and looking almost due north across Highway
129. There are many children's memorials in this area. The&nbsp;Elkridge Presbyterian Church I am told was across the road and a bit further
east of the open field shown above. Also notice the black section is up the bank
across the road to your upper left.<br>

This view standing on the northwest side of the cemetery looks southwest&nbsp; out over part of the cemetery.
Families <br>
tended to cluster together leaving wide open spaces in these old cemeteries.
Sometimes the wide open space <br>
contains the remains of unmarked graves and sometimes not. Also sometimes the
spaces contained the remains <br>
of slaves most times in unmarked graves. I do not believe there are slaves
buried here though because the <br>
families I have studied here in this cemetery had very few if any slaves. They
did their own back breaking <br>
work and were proud to tell you that.</p>
