  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Take Highway 31 Alternate 
northeast out of Pulaski for about 8 miles and
  turn right at Hopkins Rd which almost immediately merges into Blackburn Road 
at Brick Church. Turn south on Blackburn Road. At the Blackburn Road and Clock 
Creek Road merge right and go about 3 more miles. When the Blackburn Road 
terminates at Beech Hill Road (aka Old Hwy 15) turn left and after another 2/3 of a mile the 
Beech Hill Church of Christ will be on your right. Go under Interstate 65 &amp; 
travel another two miles and the Church will be on your left and the cemetery 
will be on your right.</b></font><img border="0" src="BradshawCemAerial.jpg" width="879" height="389"><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><br>
  This Aerial Map shows the plot where the cemetery resides next to Rail Lines. Beech Hill/Bradshaw/Centerpoint Road goes under Interstate Highway 65 
back to the west two miles from here. The cemetery is across the road in front of the Bradshaw 
Baptist Church as can be seen on the above aerial map. Travel to this place out 
of respect and reverence for those gone before. Come here for less than 
honorable reasons and you will be strung up to the nearest tree (figurately 
speaking, unless I catch you) by the overseers &amp; local law.<br>
