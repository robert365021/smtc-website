  (Sims Bridge Road, west of Shelbyville) BEDFORD COUNTY TENNESSEE <br>
  <img border="0" src="WilhoiteCemTopo.jpg" width="726" height="541"><br>
  From the above map we see the Wilhoite-Whitesell Cemetery GPS location. Maps 
  show this as the Whitesell-Wilhoite Cemetery. This is likely because of an 
  early cemetery historian (abt 1950) who was Ralph Whitesell who surveyed this 
  and other cemeteries. Rightly the Wilhoites were the most prominent family 
  here not taking anything away from the Whitesell family.<br>

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Shelbyville take West Lane 
  Street to Sims Road and that for a mile and 2/3 and there will be a road that 
  goes up between a house and barns to the back side of the place where the high 
  hill is on your right and the Transmission tower is also upon the hill top. 
  There is a road up to the top. Go there when it is dry or risk getting stuck. 
  As you travel down Sims Road look to your right and you should be able to see 
  the tower in the distance where you need to go.<br>
  Let me rephrase that differently:</b></font> <b>
  <font size="2" color="#000080">Go about 1 mile west of Sim's 
Bridge over the duck river, on Sim's Road. Cemetery on the right behind house &amp; barns at the top of the 
highest hill around next to a transmission tower. Tower &amp; hill can be seen before 
anything else is noticed.</font></b><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><br>

  This Aerial Map shows the square of the cemetery under the yellow pointer I 
  have placed on this map. Be prepared to climb up the steep&nbsp; hill to reach
  this cemetery, but it can be driven. The road shown here meandering north 
  spans all the way to the Duck River where Jacob Wilhoite founded the first 
  grain Mill in Bedford County in 1812. It was known as the German Mill after 
  his heritage and also the hardware to build it was made in Germany. One can 
  still identify the raceway for the mill as the mill did not span out over the 
  Duck River because of the serious issue with constant floods. The river 
  however was dammed with rocks to increase the water flow to the mill race way, 
  a man made alternate path for lesser amounts of water to stream by. Well I 
  should know how this is done as Jacob was my ancestor.</b></font><i><font size="2"><b><br>
