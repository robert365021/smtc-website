ZION BAPT. CHURCH CEMETERY, NEW ZION, Hwy 31 Alt. GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE.<br>
&nbsp; <img border="0" src="1644.JPG" width="518" height="688"><br>
CRUNK, Delia Crunk Tinnon 18 Jan 1861 - 11 Aug 1929.<br>
This stone could be listed under the surname Tinnon. It appears she was 1st the
wife of J. J. Crunk who died years before and perhaps Delia remarried to ---
Tinnon. Tinnon does not have a tombstone in this cemetery if he was laid to rest
here.&nbsp;<br>
We are in the old section, on the south side, of the old church building.<br>
