This is a view of part of the cemetery and old church building. The new building
is so new I will not show it here as we are portraying history on this site, but
it is magnificent.<br>
Church Signage which doubles as the cemetery signage in front of the old
building. The newer section of the cemetery of on our right across the road.<br>
