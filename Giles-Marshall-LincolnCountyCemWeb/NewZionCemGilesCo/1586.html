I had the privilege of meeting this hardy 91 year old lady back in July. She is
an independent breath of fresh air. She is the granddaughter of William W. Barlar
who left his second wife in Giles County and went to OK and got into the Oil
business and became wealthy. He died there and left his fortune to his wife in
OK. See Brick Church under Blanch V. Gordon Barlar.<br>

Interview of Gypsy Blanch O'malley Eslick on 1 July 2008, maiden name O'Malley,
born 1917.&nbsp;<br>
Her phone number is/(was): 615-363-1729. Her home is located at the intersection
of Blooming Grove &amp; Beech Hill Roads (Old Hwy 15) in a trailer. Trailer is
beside an old Store building still standing that was in her family.<br>
She was named by Chessie Gordon (buried in New Zion Cemetery) who was a midwife
of the area who delivered and named many of the babies around there in her time.<br>
Her Barlar grandparents were William W. &amp; Blanch V. Gordon Barlar. Blanch is
buried in Brick Church &amp; William W. is interred in (my info to her)
Wilburton Cemetery in Wilburton City Cemetery (listed in Findagrave) in OK.<br>
<br>
When asked about the stone of Willie Jones wife of W. W. Barlar installed in the
Brick Church Cemetery she could not recall who that was but I think that is a
lapse in her memory. In fact Willie Jones was the 1st wife of W.W. Barlar who
died well before Gypsy was born creating no memory of the her of the event. That
death is why W.W. Barlar married Blanch V. Gordon from the prominent Gordon
family in Brick Church community and now the Cemetery.<br>
She said W.W. Barlar left Blanch V. Gordon and went to OK so that means he went
there before 1910 when Blanch died.<br>
<br>
Gypsy had an Aunt by the name of Aunt Ruth Barlar Chapman. She was the husband
of Arthur Chapman. Arthur is not buried with her. Gypsy said Arthur was mean to
her so that is probably why Ruth chose to be interred near her son &amp;
daughter in law Clifford and Katholean Worsham Chapman all interred in the Brick
Church Cemetery. Arthur Chapman is interred in the Giles County Memorial Gardens
on the Pulaski bypass. I forgot to ask her if he had another marriage.<br>
<br>
Ruth Barlar &amp; Arthur Chapman had the following children:<br>
<br>
Clifford mentioned here already.<br>
Nat buried in Pulaski. He killed himself.<br>
Garland &quot;Shorty&quot; died recently abt 2008.<br>
<br>
When asked if the lady in Oklahoma that was the wife of W.W. (Lela Wallace) was
of Indian heritage Gypsy said she was not.<br>
<br>
Asked her if she ever received any valuable gifts from W. W. Barlar while he was
alive. He died in 1922. She said he sent the usual Christmas baskets traditional
for the times but he sent her some China at one time. She and her sister were
looking it over and her sister broke a piece of it. That started a ruckus
between her and her sister.<br>
<br>
After W.W. Barlar died in 1922 Arthur Chapman did go to OK and try to secure an
inheritance from Lela Wallace Barlar. He came back mad and empty handed as Lela
Wallace Barlar gave him no information. Asked about the info that says W.W.
Barlar was brought back to Brick Church Cemetery for burial and she said he was
not. That concurs with the grave records that says he is interred in the
Wilburton Cemetery in Oklahoma.<br>
<br>
Gypsy's mother was Hanks Lillian Barlar O'Malley and she died in 1919 She had
married William O'Malley and he is buried in she believes Giles County Memorial
Gardens or Maplewood Cemetery. Her father William then married Hazel Dean.<br>
<br>
Gypsy was raised by a black woman Lillian (I believe she said was the name.)<br>
<br>
Bud Gordon was married to a Lady from KY. Don't know what this fact has to do
with this interview but believe Bud was probably a brother of Blanch.</p>
