ZION BAPT. CHURCH CEMETERY, NEW ZION, Hwy 31 Alt. GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE.<br>
<img border="0" src="1620.JPG" width="667" height="501"><br>
ESLICK, infant of Fred A &amp; Gypsy O'Malley Eslick, no dates.&nbsp;<br>
I am going out on a limb here in identifying this as their infant. A recent
interview with Gypsy revealed to me that she had set a little angel on an
uninscribed/unmarked grave over the grave of their infant. If you can refute
this please do as I want the truth here. These little implements are new and have
not been there long. Upon seeing this photo you should know if you set these
out. If so write me at <a href="mailto:WayneaL1@aol.com">WayneaL1@aol.com</a> to
correct or confirm this. This is right next to the road on the west side 50 feet
south from the large pine tree by the Church. When confirmation comes I will
correct the above or remove this message with confirmation.<br>
We are in the old section, on the south side, of the old church building.<br>
