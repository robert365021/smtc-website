This is the only stone that has any readable inscription from the photo. The surname Dance is 
visible at the bottom of the stone.<br>
<i>Photos made about 1990 by Carl Payne in a visit to show 
Catherine Potter the Cemetery. She was reporting to a cousin who was over 90 (2002) at the 
time. Catherine later sent these copies of Carl's photos (2002) to 
me, and they have since been stored in my archive.&nbsp; Adding this cemetery is 
to keep a 
promise to Catherine &amp; Marie that I would add this cemetery to my cemetery web site. I had a conversation with Marie 
90+ myself and she was practically 
desperate for someone to document this cemetery to the public. I 
myself have been there looking for the cemetery. That was before I had mapping 
instructions and also it was late in the day so the cemetery was not found. Since it was years later I followed the maps to a Dance Cemetery on maps but 
found nothing to indicate this cemetery. I am not related to the folks in 
this cemetery that I know of, just an interested cemetery researcher. C. Wayne
