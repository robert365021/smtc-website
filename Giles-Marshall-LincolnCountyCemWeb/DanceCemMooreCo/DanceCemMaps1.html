  From the above map we see the Dance Cemetery which is marked as the Gore 
Cemetery on USGS mapping. GPS location as N 35.30225 X W 86.37247. This matches 
the original instructions I was given to get to this cemetery and also matches Mr Payne's instructions in about 2011 and on 4 Feb 2015 I confirmed all of this 
with a visit and photographs. I was told by the antebellum home occupant that 
the Gore family once lived in this home so either they chose not be be interred 
here or they are in unmarked graves. In the Moore County Cemetery book there is no 
Gore Cemetery reported which is another indication this is the Dance Cemetery. 
There is another Gore Cemetery in this Moore County on the USGS mapping, but it 
has been moved or destroyed or was a lost by being an unmarked cemetery. <br>

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Highway 55 go north of 
Lynchburg bear left on Old Lynchburg Road. Take that for 1/4 mile and turn left 
on Cashion Rd and go to the 3rd house on the right with a longest driveway. 
The houses are hard to see so after turning on Cashion Rd go over the 
East Fork of Mulberry creek and 2 tenths of a mile and turn right in the 
driveway up the slope to the house. The permission can be secured at the first 
home after passing the creek on the right. The cemetery is located 
just north of the house about 100 yards and next (east side) of a tractor 
storage barn north of the 
old home.<br>
