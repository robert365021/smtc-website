<p align="center">	<b>CHARITY CEMETERY, (off 
Charity Road on Steelman Loop Rd) MOORE COUNTY TENNESSEE</b></p>
<p align="left">	<b>AUSTIN, William 
Phillip &quot;Willis&quot;, abt 1790 - died between 1830 &amp; 1840, born, it is believed in 
Anson County, North Carolina and died in Moore/Bedford County, Tennessee, West 
Fork of the Mulberry Creek. I believe the site where they lived became part of 
Moore County in 1871.<br>

Spouse: 
Eleanor Nellie Burrow (1789 - 1892)&nbsp; -&nbsp; Findagrave.com Memorial#

Parents: 
Father: Drury/(Drewry) Austin (1755 - 
1831)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother: Elizabeth Betsy Gurley 
Austin (1753 - 1807)<br>
Known Children: Jesse James Brolin Austin (1832 - 1909)<br>
Burial: 
Unknown site in Bedford Co, Tennessee, but this researcher believed it highly 
likely Willis is interred here with his father and mother since he died and his 
wife left for Arkansas soon afterward to follow her children there.<br>
Notes: Willis was a 
sibling of Harris Austin, and also they had an unnamed sister&nbsp;who was a daughter of Drewry that married Thomas Bolin and died before Drewry Austin's will was 
probated in 1831. Her part of the estate passed to her daughter Anne Bolen. This 
daughter's given name may have been Charlotte Austin Bolen.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows the area where the cemetery resides next to what is 
labeled Stellman Loop Road inside a large rock wall. Inscribed stones here are 
sparse, and tend to occupy the southwest area of this rectangle. The area 
designated for lost and unmarked graves is large, though some part of this may 
space may have had a log Charity Church building. The West Fork of the 
Mulberry Creek is south of us and at this point has came from the west and 
turned southward. The little 
branch we see on the east side of this map spanning north to south is a 
feeder branch.<br>
