<p align="center">	<b>CHARITY CEMETERY, (off 
Charity Road on Steelman Loop Rd) MOORE COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
  <img border="0" src="CharityCemTopo.jpg" width="695" height="599"><br>
  From the above map we see the Charity Cemetery GPS location. It is on the West 
Fork of Mulberry Creek.&nbsp; <br>

</b>

  <b>Location: From Shelbyville go south on Hwy 
		231 several miles up the hill into Moore County Tennessee and turn left 
on Charity Road (Hwy 129). Follow Charity Road about 3 miles to Steelman/(Stellman) 
Loop Road and turn left. Go less than a mile or nearly until that road terminates and look left inside a very 
large rock wall where the cemetery is located.</b><font size="2" color="#000080"><img border="0" src="CharityCemArial.jpg" width="1576" height="612"><b><br>
  This Aerial Map shows the area where the cemetery resides next to what is 
labeled Stellman Loop Road. I am left wondering if at one time the Charity 
Baptist Church facility was located closer to the cemetery, though it is just 
around the corner now on Bagley Hollow Road. Part of the facility now can be seen 
on the bottom right edge of this map. <br>
