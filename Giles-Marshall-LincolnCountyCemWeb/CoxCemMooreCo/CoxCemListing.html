		* It appears a professional 
		level survey of this cemetery was done within the last 5 years to determine where all graves 
		are. Maybe ground radar or other means 
		was applied to find the unmarked graves. On the north side and scattered 
		about the graveyard are about 10 wooden stakes that mark graves that 
		were found as not having tombstone. These stakes will succumb to age in 
		several years, so these photos will become valuable in determining the 
		total number &amp; location of the graves in this cemetery. This number is 
		about 20 including these stakes. Just about every graveyard has unmarked 
		graves, if you ponder your ancestor as having died in this area study 
		this and the Census data.<br>
		I can say for sure my ancestors with lost graves, Drewy Austin (d. 1831) 
		&amp; Betsy Gurley Austin (d. aft 1831 but before 1840) lived here in the 
		headwaters area of the West Fork of Mulberry Creek. However in my case I 
		have been unable to pinpoint within a 3 miles radius the location of 
		their land. As you notice none of these marked graves are older than 
		1876, so before that all the graves here were unmarked, if this cemetery 
		existed prior to 1876.&nbsp; CWA.</p>
