  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Shelbyville go south on Hwy 
		231 up the hill onto the Chestnut Ridge &amp; pass into Moore County. After another 
		couple of miles along the ridge turn left on Charity Road and go down 
		the hill into the Valley of the headwaters of the West Fork of Mulberry 
		Creek. From 231 travel Charity Road for more than 2 miles and look 
		for the Shields Hollow Road on the right.&nbsp; Turn into Shields Hollow 
		Road and Stop and with permission to cross the farmer's land go east 200 
		yards to the cemetery behind a rock wall under several trees. I do not 
		believe there is an entrance into the cemetery so be prepared to climb a 
		low rock wall about 2 feet and descend to the other side.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery more clearly located. There is 
		no parking on the narrow Shields Road so that will be an issue for you 
		because the pavement is high above the land and will cause you to you 
		drive further up the road to find a parking spot which will not block 
		the narrow road.</font></b><br>
