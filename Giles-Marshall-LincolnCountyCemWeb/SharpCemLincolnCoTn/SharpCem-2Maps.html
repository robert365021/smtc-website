This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Sharp Cemetery as N 35.20241 X W 
86.56470. This shows the field road to the cemetery which meanders from 
northeast back to south and does not go directly beside the cemetery which 
can be seen here marked with a white check.<br>

</b></font><b>Location: From 
Fayetteville go north on Hwy 231 past Clarks Mill Rd on right and further on 
past Warden Rd on left. Just after Warden Rd look to your right and you will see 
the gate thru which takes one to the pasture and also to the cemetery on your right. With permission, 
and a key for the gate, go into the field road and follow the road northeast then back 
south to near the cemetery in a thicket. There are several thickets in that 
field but the cemetery is located inside the largest one today.</b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
