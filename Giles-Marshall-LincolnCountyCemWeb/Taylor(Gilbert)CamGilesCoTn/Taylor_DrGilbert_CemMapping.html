This map shows the coordinates of the Dr Gilbert Taylor Cemetery as N 35.24597 X W 
-87.04744.<br>
<img border="0" src="Taylor_DrGilbert_CemRd.jpg" width="1920" height="981"><br>
Location: Hwy 31N, on left about 1/4 mile past Industrial Loop Road, on fence 
line at the old Craig home (1986 instructions).<br>
This cemetery is near the old Craig Home, but not on the same property. The home 
is the 1st house on left after passing Guthrie Rd. and is an older white home 
with one tall chimney.<br>
But the cemetery is actually on the property just south of the house. Before you 
get to the driveway there is a &quot;curb cut&quot; to the open land just south of the 
house. That is what can be used to get to the cemetery. Drive as far up the hill 
(going west) as you can to the tree line and just walk inside the trees along 
the fence row (on your right) toward the top of the hill until you see the 
cemetery a little down the hill to the left of the fence line.<br>
If you ask the fellow that owns the Old Craig home it is easier to get there by 
going up the farm road that heads up the hill off of his driveway. That will 
allow you to drive closer. by Daniel Vaughn as edited by C. Wayne Austin 4 Jul
