Location: From 
Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64 to Barnes Hollow Rd and turn left (south). Follow 
that for over 2 miles and turn left onto Stevenson Road and go about 2/3 of a 
mile and turn right at the dead end into Hopper Rd. Go about another 2/3 of a 
mile and turn left onto Swan Creek Road. Follow that for about 1 and 1/2 miles 
and look left at an old barn and gate. </b></font>
<font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;With 
permission and directions go thru the gate and after bearing around the barn 
bend right (or southeast) into the field until you crest the hill and begin to descend down the hill again. You 
will then see the cemetery straight ahead occupying a clump of trees on the upper 
part of the slope (or almost a bluff)&nbsp; going down to a branch spanning 
northwest which empties into the Swan Creek spanning north/south. <br>

I have attempted to describe some of the assets you will find here that deserve 
our attention, caution &amp; respect. The cemetery is fenced but fallen in 
places.<br>

This photo was made when one could see the entire cemetery back in the winter of 
2011. It has since grown up as you will see from the photos on the front page. 
The giant tree on the far left has fallen across the gravestones and luckily did 
not hit many of them. It is now rotting and allowing weeds to grow up.<br>
