Armstrong-Sorrells Cemetery as N 35.28328 X W 
-86.58196. It is just north of a giant Beech tree next to a utility easement on 
the slope of a hill.<br>

</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Location: From 
Fayetteville go north on Hwy 231 several miles to Cold Spring Road and turn left 
or northwest. Travel that to Union Hollow Road and turn right or northeast. 
After about 500 yards look to your left at a gate and after going thru the gate 
with permission turn west and follow the utility easement (smaller power poles 
and lines) to the giant beech tree and look for the small broken stones and 
fieldstones marking this cemetery.<br>

In this view the cemetery is just this side of the tree trunk and actually 
includes the area of the tree where you will find field rocks all around the 
tree, but mostly to the north. The two marked stones are about 30 feet north of 
the tree trunk among other field stones marking graves.<br>
