  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Petersburg go out Fayetville/Lewisburg 
		Hwy aka Hwy 431 three or four miles to Bert Watt Rd and turn right (or 
		east). Travel that for 1/3 of a mile and turn left (north) into Twitty 
		Rd. Follow that until it bends left then begins to curve back around 
		right. After about 3/4 mile on Twitty Road you will see a field road 
		that is actually a gravel bed road on the right going up a gentle slope. 
		It was full of weeds when we were there. Walk or drive on that field 
		road being careful to stay on the left side because there are holes on 
		the right side of the field road. You will find the cemetery about 67 
		yards up the field road on the right after you pass a discarded concrete 
		culvert pipe.<br>
