  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville go west on Hwy 
		64 and turn left on Hwy 273 (Old Elkton Pike). Follow that nearly 15 
		miles and turn into Cemetery Ridge Road which doubles as a residential 
		road and go until you almost come to the house and look left across the 
		fence at the cemetery. There seems to be an open attitude about this 
		cemetery from the land owner but notification of your business is still 
		a good idea.<br>

  This Aerial Map shows where I highlighted the cemetery in yellow including 
		separate yellow outlines for the George Cemetery section. This is all 
		next to a private residence so do nothing to disturb the living 
		neighbors or the deceased inhabitants. I think that river seen here is the Elk River. </font></b><br>
