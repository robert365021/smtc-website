  <b>Location: From the 
junction of Highway 50/55 &amp; Hwy 64 go north about 3 miles and look to your right 
at a thicket as you go down a hill toward a creek below. The cemetery is along a 
utility easement behind a large rock wall. This is just past an old barn further 
out in the field. I will leave no further instructions as to how to get into 
this cemetery due to the briars and no parking place. The real way is determine 
the land owner and seek permission to go from the inside of his/her property. There is 
no place to park along Hwy 50/55.</b><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><br/>

  This Aerial Map shows a very yellow check to 
mark the cemetery under a utility easement which will be kept free of trees 
allowing the briars to grow unchecked.<br/>
