Obituary for Adrian Davenport Bull from Pulaski Newspaper, December 8, 1898<br>
OLD CITIZEN GONE<br>
<br>
In the death of A. D. Bull which occurred at his home in Elkton at 3 o'clock 
Monday morning, Giles County loses one of the oldest and best friends. Mr. Bull 
came to Pulaski from Ohio about 1836 or 1838 and went into business as a saddler 
and did a thriving business for awhile.<br>
He lived in a house which stood where J. B. Childers now lives, and when Mr. 
Childers, then a young man came to Pulaski in 1841, he boarded with Mr. Bull. 
About 1843 Mr. Bull went to Elkton and engaged in general merchandising. He 
prospered in business and became quite wealthy.<br>
About ten years ago he became totally blind, but his grand-daughters, especially 
Miss Marcella, were so kind and attentive to him that it was not so great an 
affliction as it would have been otherwise.<br>
Some ten days ago his health became more feeble than usual and he gradually and 
peacefully sank to sleep. The funeral was conducted Tuesday by the pastor of the 
Methodist Church and the body was laid away with the honors of the Masonic 
Lodge, the deceased having been for years a faithful member of both of these 
institutions. </font>
