Location: From 
downtown Franklin Tennessee go west on Hwy 96 to Downs Blvd and follow that 
south for about 1/2 mile and turn left into the Williamson County Soccer 
complex. When that street dead ends into a T go right (south) to the tree lined Andrews 
Cemetery on your left. It has tall chain link fence including another wooden fence with pad locks on it 
so better carry a powerful camera with a zoom lens to shoot thru the two fences 
or the photos will not be readable or locate the caretaker and get permission. I 
was visiting my grandson's soccer tournament so did not pursue the permission 
route due to time. I did not want to take anything away from his championship 
win.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

This closer image shows a yellow check mark where the cemetery resides. The 
cemetery sits above the surrounding terrain which has been modified for the 
Soccer ball fields. <br>
