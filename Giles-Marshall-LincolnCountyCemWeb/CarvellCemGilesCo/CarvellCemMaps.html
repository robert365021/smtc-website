The GPS coordinates for the Carvell Cemetery are shown on the above
map.&nbsp;Obviously these people interred in this cemetery made their living
farming the rich bottom land of the Minnow Branch Creek watershed shown spanning
northeast in the same direction as Minnow Branch Road (shown on maps and road
signage as the Apple Hill Road.)</font></b><font size="2"><b><br>

<b>Location: Highway 64 West right into Campbellsville Road. After many miles
turn right on Minnow Branch Road. Turn right again at the fork in road onto
Apple Hill Rd. Go 1 tenth of a mile and look left just past a grown up fence
line spanning north from the road and the cemetery is in the northeast corner
where the fence line meets the tree line inside a chain link fence. The many
streams that come together here provided sustenance to many pioneers in olden
days. This is highlighted indicated by the number of burial grounds in this area
as may be seen on the above MS Streets Map. This is northeast of Campbellsville
Tennessee about 3 miles.</b></font><b><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>

</font><font size="2">In this aerial view we see the brushy fence line spanning
northwest from the Apple Hill Road. The cemetery is on the right side of that
fence row in the corner just before the forest line on private land. It is
pointed out with a yellow pointer. &nbsp;<br>
