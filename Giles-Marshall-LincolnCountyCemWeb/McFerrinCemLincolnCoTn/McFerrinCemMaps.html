  From the above map we are given the GPS location of the McFerrin 
        Cemetery as N 35.08415 X W -86.64865. This map above has the road set 
too far to our left. <br>

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville go southwest on 
Hwy 110 (Ardmore Highway) about 7 miles. Go past Skinem, almost to Kirkland and 
turn right into the Camargo Rd. Follow that a couple of miles and turn left on 
Yukon Rd. Go 6 tenths of a mile and the road into the residence and back to the 
cemetery on the right. The road doubles as a farm road, cemetery road &amp; 
residential road. However there is a locked gate just to the back of the house 
to insure one gets permission from the caretaker who lives on the north side of 
Yukon Rd as you will pass right by his/her garage.<br>

shown on the left. <br>
