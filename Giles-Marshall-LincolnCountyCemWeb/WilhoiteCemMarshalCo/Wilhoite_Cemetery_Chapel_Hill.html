<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><font color="#000080">During 1962 the bodies of Governor &amp; Mrs. Henry H.
Horton were moved from the Lone Oak Cemetery in Lewisburg to this
cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
At one time this was located in the village of Wilhoite whereby a major grain milling
operation was the center of commerce along the Duck River. These mills were founded by
two brothers and a widowed mother who were John Benton &amp; Jacob R. Wilhoite
along with their mother Anna Adeline Warner Wilhoite Robinson.&nbsp;<br>
Anna Adeline Warner was the wife of deceased William Wilhoite and following his
death Anna married James Robinson who also died before this milling operation
came to fruition in 1846. This operation was located on the old Fishing Ford river
Crossing in
Marshall County Tennessee near their home. The farm and mill village
bore the name Wilhoite for many years, located today in the Henry
Horton State Park.&nbsp;<br>
Later Adeline Wilhoite Horton the daughter of John Benton Wilhoite married Henry
Hollis Horton who subsequently became Governor of Tennessee in 1927.&nbsp;<br>
The remains of the Mill can still be seen down in the bed of the
Duck River in the form of large shafts, gears and Cedars timbers that supported
the mill &amp; mill house. The original bridge piers still stand just east of the
current bridge where the main highway crossed the Duck River years ago. Also there was a large antebellum
house located near the river &amp; occupied by the Wilhoite family. That was near the
place in the park where the hotel complex is located today.</font><br>
