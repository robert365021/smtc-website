<b><font size="2" color="#000080">This is a photo of the old Wilhoite home
taken during the 1950s prior to its demolition to make way for the Henry Horton
State Park. Too bad they did not have the historical vision to incorporate it
into the park. The car sitting in the yard looks like a 1954 Chevrolet, That was
back when one could easily identify all the cars. There were fewer of them.<br>
