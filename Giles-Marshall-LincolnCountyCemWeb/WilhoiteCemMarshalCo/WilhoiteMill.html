machinery that drove one of the milling operations. This may have been a part
of the lumber milling. It was on the north side of the river and about
100 yards from the River. The grain milling operation was on or nearer the
river.<br>

A large belt spanned across this pulley driving another set of gears or pulleys.
All that was interconnected to yield the power for grinding and cutting required
to mill grain or lumber.<br>

The island jutting into the Duck River was actually at one time a part of the
original bridge that spanned over the Duck River. The village was located along
that road. When the new road was cut thru it passed by some of the original development
of the village of Wilhoite. <br>
