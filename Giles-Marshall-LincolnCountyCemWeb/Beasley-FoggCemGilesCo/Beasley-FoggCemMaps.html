  </font><font size="2" color="#006666">Go south on Hwy 166 (Bethel Road) to the 
	Crooked Hill Road and turn right. Go 1/2 mile and look west (right) for a cattle 
	gate into the pasture. With permission from Mr. Horace Fogg the farm owner go 
	into that toward the barn. Before the farm road reaches the barn bear left westward across the 
	pasture and pass under a tree line and into the next field. Next continue 
	west bearing back southward 
	looking for an opening into the next field on your left. 
	Heading southwest now go thru another tree line and out into the third open 
	field. In the third field follow the field road southwest for about 200 yards and turn 
	90 degrees right (or west) and go straight toward the forest line. Go into the 
	forest and the cemetery will begin there with the Whitscy stones and 
	then on up the incline into the main part of the cemetery for the Fogg, 
	Beasley, Black and other graves. If your approach into the forest is too far north you will be facing a 
	low grade bluff. If that is the case and 
	bear back southward until you see the first of the stones. You will find this 
	cemetery better in the wintertime.</font><font color="#008000" size="2"><br>

  This aerial view shows the Cemetery on the right side of Crooked Hill Road. A 
	yellow highlighted path is laid out here which you can follow. Each crossing 
	under a tree line has a road thru there so it can be followed. This path 
	follows a field road and must be used in dry weather. You will get stuck in 
	wet weather. I found Mr. Horace Fogg working in the field that day so 
	permission was a cinch, but I am not sure where he lives. His son lives in 
	the house just south of the highlighted path. He has a cattle operation in 
	progress here.&nbsp; </font></b><font color="#006666"><b><font size="2"><i><br>
