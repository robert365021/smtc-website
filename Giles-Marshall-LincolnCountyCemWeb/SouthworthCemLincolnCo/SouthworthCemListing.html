<p><b>Grave sinks are 
everywhere. A hazard for the less than adept on your feet:<a href="IMG_4367.JPG">4367</a></b></p>
	<p><i>Photographed on 
	Tuesday 16 Dec 2015.&nbsp; This is a large area&nbsp; of about 2 or 3 acres 
	filled with many hazards. I did not do this visit justice since I had not 
	planned on visiting this space, but believe I found most if not all the 
	inscribed stones. According to the listing above there may be more stones, 
	maybe covered in soil and debris after falling to the ground. <br>
	The inscriptions were updated with exceptions found or 
	known by C. Wayne Austin. This publication culminated from various sources. 
	Listed on page 231-232 of the book Lincoln County County Cemeteries by Tim &amp; 
	Helen Marsh, abt 1978. Source of the unmarked graves is in that book. Added here 
	26 Jan 2016. Also found on 
	Findagrave.com, but without a visit.</i></p>
