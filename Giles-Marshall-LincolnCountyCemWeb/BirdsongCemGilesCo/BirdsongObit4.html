</font><font face="Courier New" size="4">BIRDSONG, Tully The Pulaski Citizen 22 Apr 1915<br>
<br>
Prominent Young Farmer 
		Passes Away. Tully Birdsong died at his home <br>
		in the Bethesda section about midnight Friday night, April 16, 1915 and was 
		buried at the family graveyard Sunday after<br>
		funeral services by Rev. W. H. Beasley, of Elkton. Mr. Birdsong had been 
		sick only ten days of pneumonia and while<br>
		everything human skill and solitude could suggest was done for him, it 
		was evident from the first that the case was<br>
		a desperate one and continued so till the end despite the brave fight 
		the sick man and his attendants made for his life.<br>
		Mr. Birdsong was about forty four years old and was a son of the late 
		Mr. and Mrs. Logan Birdsong. He is survived by<br>
		his wife, formerly Miss Mae Abernathy and nine children, the youngest of 
		whom is only a few weeks old, Neal Birdsong<br>
		of Pulaski, and Tom Birdsong of Aspen Hill are surviving brothers.<br>
<br>
		Mr. Birdsong was a member of Bee Springs Methodist Church and took an 
		active interest in church and Sunday school work.<br>
		He also was a member of the Bunker Hill Odd Fellows Lodge. Born and 
		reared on the farm, he took advantage of the<br>
		opportunities thus afforded to study agriculture from the practical side 
		with a view to making it his life's work,<br>
		and the result was that he was one of the most successful young farmers 
		in Giles county, good business methods, <br>
		energy, intelligence and honesty being some of his characteristics, Mr. 
		Birdsong was a member of the Giles County<br>
		Farmer's Association and took a keen interest in farm and rural life 
		development, and in his passing away, Giles<br>
		County has lost on of its best citizens. The funeral procession was one 
		of the largest even seen in the county.<br>
