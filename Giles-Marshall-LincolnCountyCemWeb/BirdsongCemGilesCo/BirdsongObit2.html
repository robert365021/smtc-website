<br>
		Mrs. Logan Birdsong, a prominent citizen of Giles County, was found dead 
		in a barrel of water, at her home on <br>
		Monday afternoon, June 24. For some weeks, Mrs. Birdsong had been in 
		poor health, and in a very despondent mood, <br>
		but was up and able to be about. Some of her children or relatives had 
		been staying with her and her son had <br>
		just left her. The cook, who lives on the place, went up to be with her 
		and found her in the barrel, head foremost.<br>
		The alarm was given at once and neighbors came to the rescue, but she 
		was dead when taken out. <br>
		Mrs. Birdsong was the widow of Logan Birdsong and leaves several 
		children, two of whom are Messrs. Neal and Tully <br>
		Birdsong of Pulaski. She was a good woman, highly respected by all who 
		knew her. Services were conducted at the <br>
		home and the burial took place in the family burying ground.<br>
