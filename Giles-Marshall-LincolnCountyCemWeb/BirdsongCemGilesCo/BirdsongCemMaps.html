Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski and turn west (left) on Tarpley Shop Road. 
Follow that for just over 3 miles and with permission turn left into a private 
drive. The Cemetery can be seen from this road about 300 yards on your left out 
in a pasture at the gated stop to the private residence. It will be under a 
couple of old cedar trees.<br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery under the small clump of trees out in a 
pasture. You will not be able to visit this cemetery without the help of the 
owner, because there are three fences and three gates between the residential 
road and the cemetery. All or none of them may be locked.<br>
