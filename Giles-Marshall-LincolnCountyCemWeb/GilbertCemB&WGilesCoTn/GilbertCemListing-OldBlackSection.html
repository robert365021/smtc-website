	<p>It is my opinion that the above listing 
	has more than one source and therefore may have duplication in it. For 
	instance maybe a John Gilbert with a tombstone and dates may be the same 
	listing as John Gilbert no dates or other information. We chose not to guess 
	at elimination of duplication due to inability to get that right. Main 
	source was the book Giles County Tennessee Cemeteries, but updates were made 
	with tombstone information that showed any changes. Of course as some stones 
	have been broken we included the information from the listing in the book 
	unverified.</p>
	<p><font color="#CC3300" size="2">This great old cemetery was apparently 
	unique in its time as both white Gilbert family members and friends are 
	buried there as well as Gilbert slaves and their descendants. Former slave Mintie Gilbert Wood made this statement when interviewed about being a slave 
	of Cary Gilbert, Thomas' son, &quot;...he has his own graveyard where everyone of 
	us black or white dat ever been in de Gilbert family can be buried without 
	costing us a penny.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Descendants of the slaves maintained the cemetery well into the 20th 
	century, but as more and more have moved away and time has passed, it has 
	long since become overgrown. The fence has been felled by trees on occasion, 
	but makeshift repairs have been made by someone. Now only the new black 
	section is being actively maintained.<br>

Page 145-147 by the Historical Society about 1985. Presented on Findagrave.com with 
most of the listings, a few were omitted and others included that I did not 
find because there were unmarked or not interred here. Also on findagrave.com 
	the old cemetery was co-mingled between African Americans and whites. 
	However I cannot say that is precise included above either. Generally blacks
