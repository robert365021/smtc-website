<p><font face="Arial">ABERNATHY, Bob The Pulaski Citizen 26 Oct 1927 Sparks from 
Crack Hill by Sunshine<br>
In Bob's early days he was handicapped for life's duties. So he attended school 
at Giles College for some years which prepared him for most any job which came 
his way. He was a good hand on the farm, a devout church goer. It can truthfully 
be said he had no enemies. He lived with Mr. and Mrs. Bascom Abernathy until 
they moved to the city, then he moved to Sidney Paysinger's where he spent his 
declining days helping Mrs. Paysinger with the children. He fell and broke his 
leg recently and soon passed away. He had a decent burial by Jim Adkins and 
Sidney Paysinger. He was a devout Christian gentleman and he believed the holy 
writ, every word of it.<br>

where he was reared, having been in business there several years prior to moving 
to Pulaski. Mr. Abernathy was quiet, gentlemanly, honest and honorable, in all 
his dealings, and his character was of a very high type. He was a member of the 
Odd Fellows and the Woodmen, who participated in the funeral rites. Surviving 
him are his wife, formerly Miss Beulah Hamlett, and two children who have the 
sympathy of many friends in their great bereavement, by the loss of a kind and

ADKINS, Lee Roy The Pulaski Citizen 18 Aug 1923<br>
Lee Roy Adkins was born in Marion County, Ala., Dec. 15, 1850 and came to Giles 
County, Tennessee about 35 years ago. He was a hard-working man and a good 
citizen, a neighbor and church man. When his mind was converted he thought 
right, when his heart was converted he acted right, and when his pocket book was 
converted he paid right, surely those three things befell Mr. Adkins. And if you 
had been in close touch with him, as the writer was, you would have known it. 
When the Church of Sunday School called for anything, he was there and stayed 
until it was settled and settled right. And as a neighbor he had few equals and 
no superiors. Anything that he had was for his neighbor, if he wanted it. He was 
a corner post for his church, and will be badly missed. He had been in declining 
health for two years. All was done that human aid could do but like some weary 
traveler he fell asleep Aug. 10, 1923. He leaves a widow, two sons, and five 
daughters to mourn his death.<br>
Funeral services conducted by Rev. T. E. Hudson at his home. Burial at the

but he cannot return to us. A friend and neighbor.<br>

BASS, James Autry The Pulaski Citizen 29 Apr 1925<br>
James A. Bass, seventeen year old son of W. T. Bass, who lives at the old Waters 
home place at Pleasant Hill, killed himself about 7:30 Monday morning. It may 
never be known whether the killing was accidental or with suicidal intent.<br>
James was a fine, manly fellow of good character and habits. He attended Sunday 
School Sunday morning and made a talk at the Epworth League meeting Sunday 
evening. Monday morning he rose as usual, milked the cows and returned to the 
house with the milk. Then taking a shot gun he walked away. His brother saw him 
leave the house with the gun, but thought nothing of it supposing he had seen a 
hawk or something. In a few minutes came the report of the gun, and whne members 
of the family saw James, almost the entire face was shot away. The charge had 
evidently entered under the chin and ranged upward, the head apparently being 
inclined up or back, so the charge came out at the forehead, tearing away mouth, 
nose and eyes. James lingered in agony about an hour and a half. He was 
apparently conscious. By his movements he showed that he understood when members 
of the family spoke to him. But he could not speak, nor could he see to write a 
word of explanation of the tragedy.<br>
After funeral services Tuesday by Rev. T. H. Porter, the body was laid away to 
await the final summons.<br>

Larkin Birdsong died at his home at Bethesda, Dec. 27, 1920, aged 73 years and 
ten months. He was born and lived his entire life in that community. After any 
one is dead, we can always find good in them, but here was one who you never 
heard a word spoken against while he was living. Peculiar in many ways, he was 
as true and harmless as a man could be. He was out of the county but once; was 
never on a jury; never voted and was never a witness in a trial; never rode on a 
railroad or automobile, and probably never made as much as a thousand dollars in 
one year during his long life. His home was of the old type, but it was a home

Newton Birdsong, died Sunday at his home near Kelly's Bridge on Richland Creek 
in Giles County, Tenn. His devoted wife preceded him to the beyond a few weeks 
since.<br>
This man was a quiet , modest unassuming gentleman, had reared a family of pure 
girls and honest boys. I am not sorry he has passed across the river and feel 
sure he is not. He had served his day and generation and had served it well. In 
the last few months sorrow's crown of thorns had been by fate, pressed to his 
brow. His loved ones and loving companion of years had passed. Life was coming 
to the &quot;sere and yellow leaf&quot;, and I know of no neighbor of Thomas Birdsong who 
is a better husband, friend or man than he was. If all and even one half of 
those who survive him will live and act as well as he, the community and society 
both are safe.<br>

under the water, overflowing the dam, and Cardin was drowned, the other two 
narrowly escaping with great bruises. Although Rev. S. M. Ensor and John L. 
Stevenson were present, on the shore, assistance could not save Mr. Cardin, as 
it was impossible to locate him and a thorough search has been made ever since 
the deplorable accident, the body has not yet been recovered from the waters. 
The force of the water was so great that the boat was completely wrecked, and 
the action was all but instantaneous after the boat hit the overflow. Mr. Cardin 
was the son of Ezra Cardin, Bunker Hill and about 18 years of age.<br>

work plowing.<br>
Mr. Cardin appeared well as usual Tuesday forenoon. After working all morning he 
came home to dinner, ate a hearty meal and returned to work. He did not come 
home at the usual time in the evening, but at first the family thought nothing 
of it, supposing he was just working later than usual. But as night was coming 
on and he had not come home, some one went to the field to see about him. 
Apparently he had died of heart failure, without warning. He had fallen forward, 
face down, with the plow line about his wrist. The horse has been grazing round 
apparently for several hours. It is supposed Mr. Cardin died soon after 
returning to work for the afternoon.<br>

COLLINS, Ella Josephine Loyd Pulaski Citizen 14 Jul 1923<br>
<br>
Pulaski people were greatly shocked Saturday morning to learn of the sudden 
death of Mrs. Roy P. Collins Friday night. Mrs. Collins was spending the night 
with her grandchildren while their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Collins went 
to Elkmont Springs. On their return a little past mid night they were met by the 
children who were crying because they could not awaken &quot;Grandma.&quot; It was quickly 
discovered that &quot;Grandma&quot; would awake no more to scenes of earth. She has passed 
away, perhaps as a result of heart trouble.<br>
Funeral services were held at the Methodist Church Sunday morning by her pastor 
Rev. J. R. Parsons, assisted by Rev. M. S. Kennedy and Rev. John Durrett. A 
large crowd of sorrowing friends and relatives and a wreath of beautiful florals

the Home Study Circle of Pulaski. A band of women who for various reasons could 
not conveniently attend Sunday School. They studied the lessons at home and 
those who could do so met on Saturday afternoon to talk over the lessons 
together. Mrs. Collins was a leader in this work, and will be sadly missed by 
those to whom she brought cheering words and comforting thoughts in time of 
trouble, sickness or sorrow.<br>
An active life filled with deeds of kindness of which her last act, taking care 
of the children that others might enjoy a pleasant outing, was characteristic, 
is closed. And many hearts are sad because of the going away of this good 
mother.<br>

all who knew her.<br>
<br>
This friend ours measured up to the highest standard as wife, mother, neighbor 
and church member and her going away leaves a vacant place that none can fill so 
well as she. She will be greatly missed by friends and loved ones. But most of 
all she will be missed at home. Peaceful and sweet seemed her sleep. With the 
lips that always smiled a welcome to her friends closed with a smile still, the 
hands that were always busy for some one are at rest.<br>
The soul which had been washed and made white in the blood of the lamb is safe 
in the arms of Jesus. A Friend.<br>

claimed for its victim their infant son, John Houston, aged 4 months. Sad indeed 
it was for the fond parents but he was too precious for this cold and sinful 
world so God called him to a home of eternal life and beauty. Dear father and 
mother may you both so live as to meet him there where you will see him a little 
white robed angel. A Friend.<br>

HARWELL, Nancy Ezell Pulaski Citizen 12 Nov 1924 Woodrow &amp; Frankewing &quot;Dr. Love&quot;<br>
Death has again removed one of our old fashioned land marks in the person of 
Mrs. Harwell who departed this life Nov. 3, 1924, at the home of her only son, 
Walter Harwell, where she had been an invalid for some time. We wrote a sketch 
of her about twelve months ago. But now she rests from all her labors and 
sorrows, and is living in that bright world where they need no write ups for all 
that we could ever do or say for her has been done and said. The beautiful 
floral offering that decorated her grave came too late for her to see.. We can 
cheer the living but never the dead. Therefore we prefer to write them up while 
they are living and can appreciate what we say about them. We find this style of 
flowers has proven satisfactory for the living as well as for ourselves. If we 
cannot all write we can visit the sick and take them flowers and speak words of 
cheer and comfort before they pass through the dark valley and shadow of death. 
For there is no human light that can penetrate that valley. But if we have faith 
in Him who burst the bars of death and rose a triumphant conqueror over death, 
hell and the grave. We can find light in the valley of death as thousands have 
done who believed in the Divine bridges that Jesus built for us to cross from 
mortality to immortality. She leaves one son, and one daughter, Mrs. Walter 
Smith, twenty one grandchildren and four great grandchildren and one sister, 
Mrs. Jim Samuels. In the absence of her pastor, services were held at Pisgah by 
the Rev. J. R. Parsons of Pulaski, where she was buried beside her husband, Cape 
Harwell.<br>

was a Christian gentleman, honest and upright in his dealing, a good neighbor, a 
kind, loving husband and father, a man who loved the Lord with all his heart and 
all his soul and his neighbor as himself.<br>
He is survived by his second wife, Mrs. Lucy Harwell and two sons, Clyde 
Harwell, Frankewing, Clifford Harwell, Louisville, Ky., and one daughter, Mrs. 
Hattie Harwell and several grandchildren and the following brothers, Lester

Cemetery. We extend our sincere sympathy to the bereaved family especially to 
the children because it seems so hard to give up both mother and father and to 
them we will say, &quot;Grieve not for father but think of as sleeping in Jesus, And 
let his noble life be as a comforter to you.&quot;<br>

He had been a member of the Methodist Church for thirty years and know ye that a 
Prince and a great man is fallen in Israel. He was a true man, of the old type 
and if all men were of his type there would be only one law and that would be a 
law of love. If he had an enemy, it was not known.<br>
Mr. Marks had not moved his hands for several hours before the end came. But as

the spirit land. He was a good man and full of years. He was the last of the old

years, 9 months. She was a livelong member of the Methodist Church, to which she 
was very devoted, always defending its great principles. She was loyal to her 
friends and family in sickness, and all kinds of adversity. Unpretentious, hers 
was a life of unselfishness and her virtues were many.<br>
She was the last of a large family of brothers and sisters, sons and daughters 
of the late Maj. Lewis B. Marks, of the Friendship Community, who with his 
parents and brothers, Edward ,William, Milton, and John came to Giles County 
more than a century ago from the village of Nashville, Tenn., cutting away the 
cane a part of the way to their new home three fourths of a mile north east of 
Blooming Grove Church. The original log house is standing there now. Only a few 
years previous they had emigrated to Davidson County from Virginia.<br>

and Rev. Logan D. Harwell, the latter being the father of Mrs. Jno. M. Aymett, 
deceased, Mrs. Henry Aymett, Mrs. Neil Birdsong, Mrs. Sallie Montgomery and Miss 
Mamie Harwell. The original Harwell's emigrated from North Carolina early in the 
19th century.<br>
One by one the old land marks are being obliterated by death or the hand of 
progressive humanity and except faint memory, we have little to remind us of the 
long ago, but they say we must look forward, not backward. Yet the best that is 
in many of us is derived from memory of the lives of saints long departed. L. M. 
Marks. Frankewing, Tenn. Aug. 16, 1927<br>

indigestion.<br>

type of christian character, true, and devoted alike, to her family, her friends 
and her God. To know her, was to love her, for she was a woman in which there 
was no guile, and against whom none could say aught. She was never so happy as 
when doing good deeds, and working for the happiness of others. Surely she has 
gone to the reward which awaits the righteous.<br>
The home is broken up, for &quot;sister,&quot; as every one lovingly called her, was the 
only child left at home to cheer and comfort her parents in their declining 
years, the others all being in homes of their own.<br>
May He who doeth all things well, abide with them, in their great and crushing 
sorrow.<br>

SCALES, Tranquilla Gracy The Pulaski Citizen 04 Jul 1928 Sparks from Crack Hill<br>
Mrs. J. R. Scales passed away at her home June 30th, age seventy years, three 
months, and nineteen days. She had been a great sufferer for a year or two. All 
was done that human aid could do, but to no avail. She was converted and joined 
the Methodist Church at the age of eleven years, and lived a consistent life to 
the end. She was much devoted to the cause she loved, the church Sunday school, 
the Epworth League and was loyal to the cause in every way. Many are the people 
who in the past were in her class at Sunday School and her life was a great 
inspiration to them. The ones who knew her best loved her best. She like some 
weary traveler wrapped the mantle of her couch around her and lay down to 
pleasant slumber to await the resurrection morn. Services conducted by her 
pastor, Rev. A. J. Allison. Burial at Maplewood Cemetery Sunday in the presence 
of a large crowd of relatives and friends.<br>

30, at 12:55 a.m. In the going of Mrs. Scales a loving wife, a devoted mother, 
an unselfish neighbor and an earnest church worker has gone from us. Since early 
childhood, she has been a consistent member of the Methodist Church. She will be 
remembered for her bright disposition and for her kindly thoughtfulness of 
others. Her presence in the home, in the neighborhood, and in the church will 
long be missed because she filled so full of life and love each of those places.<br>
The intense suffering of her last days failed to check the cheerful word and the 
genial smile for her friend and neighbor. Such a life is a beacon pointing the 
way to those left behind.<br>

STEVENSON, Annie Hobbs The Pulaski Citizen 24 Jul 1935<br>
Backward turn backward, O time in your flight, Make me a child again, just for 
tonight.&quot;<br>
I think sometimes I should like to go back and live over my childhood days, just 
to be with my mother.<br>
Annie Hobbs Stevenson was born April 5, 1861 and died July 6, 1935. She was the 
daughter of Nathaniel and Margaret Hobbs, of Coldwater, Tenn.<br>
Becoming a Christian in early life she was a life-long member of the Methodist 
Church.<br>
She was married December 20, 1883 to J. M. Stevenson, at which time she came to 
Bryson to make her home. Her husband J. M. Stevenson passed away May 9, 1926, 
making it lonely for his aged companion but she bore life's sorrows courageously 
and enjoyed life's blessings gratefully. My mother was a pure, sweet, good 
woman. She was devoted to her loved ones, loyal to her home, untiring in her 
efforts to do that which was right and uplifting. To the best interest of 
friends and neighbors, she was ever ready to do her part and to church she was 
always faithful. Hr going away brings deep sorrow to those who loved her. We 
shall miss her sweet face, her prayers, her love, her advice, but her sweet 
influence will live with us forever.<br>
The following children survive: Nathaniel, Leon, Allen and Aaron Stevenson, 
Linda Stevenson Fautt, Adelaide Stevenson Maddox and Sally Jean Stevenson. The 
grandchildren are: John Henry Stevenson, Glenn Stevenson, Janelle Stevenson, 
Bobby and Edith Fautt, James, Martha, Margaret and Mary Maddox. There are two 
sisters who survive, Mrs. J. B. Cheatham of Coldwater, Mrs. J. T. Rowell of

death was then expected almost daily. But she improved, and was able to return 
home in the spring.<br>
After funeral services at Bee Spring Memorial Church, the body was brought to 
Pulaski for burial in Maplewood Cemetery.<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson lived in Pulaski for some time. But returned to their 
comfortable home on the farm some ten years ago.<br>
She was a good woman and her going away will be sadly missed, not only in the 
home, but in the church and community.<br>
<br>
STEVENSON, James McKendree The Pulaski Citizen 26 May 1926<br>
&quot;A Memoir&quot; It is just the beginning of eventide; the bird has almost finished 
his song for the hush of night; the sun in the Western horizon, will soon drop 
below the bounding line; a cloud of hast, seemingly attempts to shut it from 
view. But with a noticeable suddenness, is, by some unseen force rent assunder 
and with a light beautiful indeed the entire landscape is flooded.<br>
<br>
As I pass into the gate of his home sudden and saddening cries fall upon the 
ear; which, experience has taught us all, can come only from hearts that have 
received the thrust that only Death's dagger alone can strike. Without being 
informed, I am made to realize that the soul of my kinsman and life-long friend, 
James McKendree Stevenson, has left the emaciated and worn out body, and that 
the portals of eternal life have been unlocked for him by Death's hand.<br>
He was born Nov. 14, 1857. Became a Christian in very early life. Was married to 
Annie Hobbs Dec. 20, 1883. Departed this life May 9, 1926.<br>
When I first began to take notice of men, when but a very small lad he was among 
the first of men, outside of our own family group to make an impress on my boy 
mind.<br>
Always full of life, energy and vigor. In character, affable, courteous, gentle. 
From very early boyhood days I have watched him day by day, under all 
circumstances and conditions, as only a boy can watch a man whom he greatly 
admires and cannot recall any thing observed, unbecoming the ideal gentleman.<br>
He would not will that I should say that he made no mistakes or had no 
imperfections. A man, clean in life an character. He could not endure foulness, 
uncleanliness in any form.<br>
To the best interests of the community he was ever ready to do his part and 
more. To his church he was faithful; to his friends loyal; to his family tender 
and devoted.<br>
In his devotion of friendship, he seemingly did not stop to figure up the cost 
of what it might mean to be a friend to man.<br>
His community has suffered great impoverishment because of his death; but it has 
been greatly and wonderfully enriched because of his life.<br>
To the aged companion, his devoted wife, who, for a long period of years has 
born life's sorrows and enjoyed life's blessings by his side; to the three 
daughters, Mrs. Robert Fautt, Mrs. Auburn Maddox and Miss Sallie Jean Stevenson, 
to the four sons, Nathaniel, Leon, Allen and Aaron; to the two brothers, Elam A. 
And T. Marion and his host of friends and kinsmen, we wish to express a very 
deep sens of sympathy.<br>
The hand of disease lay heavily upon him until the tired form became emaciated 
to the extreme. It was then, his friend, (not enemy) Death came to release him 
from the chains.<br>
&quot;God sends death to deliver us from pain, misery and disappointments.&quot;<br>
&quot;To them who are saved by the blook of the Lamb, death is indeed a friend. He is 
the end of all travail, the door of desires, the gate of gladness, the port of 
paradise, the haven of heaven, the beginning of all blessings. Sterling E. 
Stovall Bryson, Tenn., May 24, 1926<br>
<br>
STEWART, Ozella Hardeman The Pulaski Citizen 24 Aug 1922<br>
Mrs. Ozella Stewart, sister of W. W. Hardeman, died at their home in North 
Pulaski yesterday morning, after many weary months of suffering from that most 
dreaded disease, cancer. Mrs. Stewart has been in a critical condition for 
several weeks, and the end was not unexpected.<br>
The funeral service will be held this morning followed by burial at Maplewood 
Cemetery.<br>
<br>
STOVALL, Sarah Elizabeth Stevenson The Pulaski Citizen 28 Dec 1927<br>
A grand-daughter of Rev. Elam Stevenson, the founder of Beespring Church and a 
daughter of T. C. Stevenson and wife of T. M. Stovall, also mother of the Hon. 
S. E. Stovall. To let a character like this pass from our midst with nothing but 
a card of thanks from her children was more than I could endure. She was perhaps 
the oldest direct descendant of the founder of Beespring. At the time of her 
death Miss Sarah, as we all called her, was nothing more than an humble 
Christian, and there is no fear of pen nor words making a white-washed obituary 
for her life of eighty-two years. She joined the church in early childhood and 
that sacred vow she knew was registered in heaven.<br>
She was one of the last persons I remember seeing shout. It was a benediction to 
any one to see her shout. For she had heart-felt religion, not at church alone, 
but around her own hearth stone and among her neighbors or wherever she was. You 
would realize that there was something of her that was not of most people. She 
lived for God, the church and Sunday School, three in one, or one in three.<br>
No one ever questioned Miss Sarah's religion. Her life was an open book. She was 
a devout mother in Israel. Four four score years she walked with God. And 
recently she got nearer God's home than her own, then she went home with God.

TARPLEY, Lawrence Pulaski Citizen 03 Aug 1922 Sparks From Crack Hill &quot;Sunshine&quot;<br>
Lawrence Tarpley, a son of Guy Tarpley, died July 25th, after a short illness of 
galloping consumption. While he had never enjoyed the pleasure of good health, 
yet it was not generally known that he was sick. He was as pure a boy as any I 
ever knew. If he had any bad traits, the writer never heard or knew of them. He 
was a member of the Methodist Church, and it can truly be said he lived up to 
the vows. Burial at the Scruggs graveyard, services conducted at the grave by 
Rev. J. H. Porter.<br>
<br>
TARPLEY, Malissa Ann Kellum The Pulaski Citizen 25 Mar 1925<br>

a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church all of her life of immortality, 
beyond the grave. She was social, pleasant and interesting in her conversation. 
For a lady of her age, she was an exception. Her husband, Esq. T. E. Tarpley, 
preceded her three months and nineteen days. And thus a home where two had 
passed the four score mark is vacant. And the two have joined each other in the 
home of the blest. Their children, Mrs. Emmett McGrew, Mrs. J. E. Cameron and 
three sons, S. E., Guy and Tarpley survive. Services were conducted at the home 
by Rev. T. H. Porter. Burial at Marks graveyard where there was a large 
gathering of friends and neighbors.<br>

Mrs. Guy Tarpley died last Friday of tuberculosis, aged forty four years. She 
had been a member of the Methodist Church for many years. She was a good 
neighbor and a Christian woman. It was sad indeed to see her taken from her 
children, just when they need her most, but all was done, but to no avail. She 
leaves a husband and four children to mourn her death. Mrs. Tarpley was 
perfectly reconciled and said there was nothing in her way only her loved ones 
she had to leave behind. She was buried at the Scruggs graveyard, services by 
Rev. J. W. Parrish. Mrs. J. T. Ragsdale and sons of Decatur were called home by 
the death of Mrs. Guy Tarpley.<br>

Tarpley's Shop before that office was discontinued on account of rural free 
delivery.<br>

the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. He is survived by his wife and five

Mr. and Mrs. Thurman have been living with Mr. and Mrs. Arney since their 
marriage, just a few weeks ago.<br>
Mrs. Thurman who before marriage was Miss Lucile Arney, died of pneumonia after 
a few days illness. Her death will come as a great shock to her many friends, as

her up, but God need another angel to make heaven brighter. So he called little
