Journeying to Pulaski in Giles County, Judge Allen was instructed in law by 
eminent lawyers in that town with whom he became acquainted.<br>
While studying law in the offices of Thomas Barnett, Mr. Allen taught in Pulaski 
schools for more than two years. Following his admittance to the bar shortly 
afterwards, Judge Allen set out with a horse and buggy, traveling westward in 
search of a suitable location in which to practice his profession.<br>

H. Washington. A resident of Nashville continuously since that time, he retired 
from active law practice early in 1932. During the ensuing years he has resided 
on his farm at Hendersonville on the Gallatin Road.<br>
While retired, Judge Allen still displayed an active interest in legal 
activities and as late as four months ago was associated in conduct of a $5,000 
lawsuit against a railroad in connection with fatality occurring on railroad 
property, which he won.<br>
Active in church work throughout his career, Judge Allen was a member of the

<br>
About two weeks ago, Mr. Ball shot and killed a rabbit. He had a little pimple, 
or slight abrasion on the hand. But thought nothing of it. Perhaps did not know 
the danger of handling a rabbit or squirrel, with a sore place on the hand. In a 
few days the little sore place became infected, became red, painful and swollen. 
The infection spread rapidly, developing into pneumonia. And death resulted.<br>
Tularama, or rabbit fever, was not know until recently. It was discovered in 
California, but has spread pretty well over the country. Not all rabbits or 
squirrels are effected. But many are. It is a germ disease, and thorough cooking 
kills the germs. So there is no danger in eating rabbit or squirrel that has 
been well cooked. But it is dangerous to get the raw blood on the hands, 
especially if there is a broken place in the skin. The only safe way to handle 
or dress rabbit, is to weat good rubber gloves, and wash them clean after use.<br>

Scott and White hospital in Temple, Texas. The funeral service was held at the 
home in Palacios on Sabbath afternoon at 1:30 with Rev. George F. Gillespie 
officiating in the absence of Rev. J. E. Mack, pastor of the Methodist Church, 
who was out of town attending a Church conference. The preacher chose as his 
Scripture passage, 2 Cor., Ch. 5, vv.1 and 8, and Psalm 15. He said Psalm 15 
contained a description of a citizen of Zion, or in other words it described a 
Christian gentleman. The preacher said he had known the deceased intimately for 
21 years, and paid tribute to his loyalty as a friend, his kindness of heart, 
and his love of home.<br>
Mr. Brandon was a man of high principle. He had certain rules of conduct which 
he always carried out in his business and in his private life, and these were 
exemplified in the verses read from the 15th Psalm. Without truth there can be 
no virtue. Mr. Brandon believed in speaking the truth in his heart, he walked 
uprightly and worked, righteousness, and considered always that a man's word was 
as good as his bond. He was born in Pulaski, Giles County, Tenn. His father was 
a farmer, and he often talked about his early life and upbringing on the farm. 
He attended Giles College in his native county, and came to Columbus, Texas, at 
an early age, where his brother Kenneth had preceded him. He was a commercial 
traveler for 25 years-working 22 years for the same company-and afterwards 
engaged in ranching and rice farming. While living in Columbus he was united in 
marriage to Miss Lena Farmer, and to this union was born one son, Thomas. During 
the years he lived in Columbus he was an active worker in the Knights of Pythias 
Lodge. He came to Palacis 32 years ago and engaged in the dry goods business 
until he turned the business over to his son a few years ago. Mr. Brandon was 
spared to a ripe old age. He was successful in his business undertakings. 
Perhaps his distinguishing trait was that he enjoyed life. He was known for his 
hearty laugh and for his love of company. He was a sincere and loyal Christian 
having been a member of the Methodist Church for many years. He was a liberal 
giver to all the cause of the church. He always attended church worship both 
morning and evening, and sang in the choir. The members of the Methodist Church 
will miss his cheery presence and his friendly ways.-G. F. Gillespie in Palacios 
Newspaper.<br>
Mr. Brandon kept in touch with his old home by keeping up his subscription to 
the Citizen.<br>

Death ended the life of Helen Brashears, known to many friends here and at a 
distance as &quot;The Little Soldier on the home front,&quot; at one-thirty Tuesday 
afternoon at the Pulaski Hospital, the scene of much of her valiant fight for 
survival during the months she had been undergoing painful and tedious treatment 
that involved grafting of skin to her severly burned back.<br>
The little patient had regained consciousness after undergoing the third of a 
series of skin grafting operations Tuesday morning and had spoken a few words to 
her solicitous doctors and nurses when her tired little heart called a halt to 
her fight to live.<br>
In her last hours, as in the hours of every day that she had spent as a patient 
at the hospital, the skillful hands of doctors and nurses did everything humanly 
possible to prolong the life of the little girl, whose patient endurance of the 
suffering had won the love of every member of the hospital work force.<br>
The little girl was brought to the hospital from her home in the Bodenham 
community in the latter part of December, when her clothing caught fire at an 
open grate as she stood with her back to the fire.<br>
In the intervening months, kindhearted doctors and nurses and the many friends 
whose gifts have been showered on &quot;the little soldier&quot; have left nothing undone 
that would add to her comfort. That realization is a source of consolation to 
the heart-broken father and his other four motherless children, whose gratitude 
is boundless.<br>
Funeral services for the little girl were held at four o'clock Wednesday 
afternoon at the Scott's Hill Baptist Church by Elder Harry R. Fox, pastor of 
the Pulaski Church of Christ, and butial was by the side of her mother's grave 
in the church cemetery.<br>

Jean Brashears; and by a brother, Loyd Brashears, whose home is on the farm of 
Walter Burns in the Bodenham community.<br>

CAMPBELL, Luther Brady The Pulaski Citizen 19 Jun 1940<br>
Luther B. Campbell, 48, Clear Creek farmer in the Shores Mill community was shot 
Sunday evening about 6 o'clock. And apparently died instantly. The bullet 
entered the breast near the heart,, and passed through the body.<br>
No other member of the family was in the house at the time, according to 
statements made to officers out of the Sheriff's office, investigating the case.<br>
Mrs. Campbell had gone to the spring, about a hundred yards from the residence, 
to leave a bucket of milk. She and her husband had been talking together just 
before she left the house with the bucket of milk. She said she heard no shot, 
and was much surprised to find her husband lying on his face, dead in a great 
pool of blood.<br>
Officers and citizens investigating the case Monday, after a preliminary 
investigation Sunday night, reached the conclusion, it was a case of suicide. 
But according to reports it is difficult to reconcile the facts. But Mr. 
Campbell is said to have been a peaceable citizen and if had an enemy who might 
have killed him, no one seems to know anything about it.<br>
There was a little 22 rifle in the home. But this was in the rack, in a 
different room. And there was no indication of powder burn on the shirt or body 
where the bullet entered. And it is hard to conceive how a man might have shot 
himself through the heart, left no sign of powder burn, unbreached the rifle, 
removed the empty shell, placed the rifle in the rack, passed out of one door 
into a hall, crossed the hall and passed through another door in the room where 
the body was found, leaving no trace of blood anywhere, except the pool where 
the body was lying.<br>
Funeral services were held at Scott's Hill Baptist Church Monday afternoon.<br>

COLE, Wilson The Pulaski Citizen 2 Jul 1941<br>
Esq. Wilson Cole who lived about four miles out on the Minor Hill Road, died 
under rather mysterious circumstances Friday night. The body was found, parked 
in his auto, on the road near Cope Whitfield's Saturday morning. And because no 
one knew how he came to be there, an inquest was held. But nothing suspicious 
was developed.<br>
Mr. Cole left home late Friday evening to attend the regular weekly meeting of 
the Odd Fellows Lodge. There was nothing unusual about that. He often attended 
the lodge meetings. On this occassion he brought some of the children to the 
picture show. And expected to take them home, after the lodge meeting.<br>
He attended the lodge meeting, and was one of the last to leave. Nobody, so far 
as known, has any definite idea of his movements, after he left the lodge. One 
guess may be as good as another.<br>
Our guess is, that the paralytic stroke, which is supposed to have caused his 
death, came on gradually. That he was somewhat confused when he reached his car, 
and so forgot all about the children. That he got into the car and started home 
as he thought. But at the Highway crossing at Windsor Village, he went south on 
31 instead of going west on 64. At Cemetery Street he turned left on Cemetery 
Street, in his confused condition, instead of turning on the Minor Hill road as 
he supposed. He probably passed out beyond John Burns' place, struck the Owl 
Hollow Road, and was going west toward Highway 31, when he realized that he was 
seriously sick, and completely lost.<br>
Apparently, he had stopped the car, left the lights burning and got out of the 
car, possibly to call for help. Not seeing a house near, apparently he started 
to get back into the car. One foot was on the running board, one on the ground, 
and the upper part of the body, was slumped into the car, in which position the 
body was found next morning.<br>
Our information is that Dr. Blackburn, after examining the body, said death 
probably resulted from paralysis, and that he had probably been dead about eight 
hours, when found.<br>
When Mr. Cole failed to return from the lodge meeting, Friday night, Mrs. Cole 
naturally became alarmed, called members of the lodge, and efforts were made to 
fine him. But the body was not discovered until people began to stir Saturday 
morning.<br>
<br>
COLE, T. Wilson Cole The Pulaski Record 2 Jul 1941<br>
The body of T. Wilson Cole, 60, Giles County farmer and assistant rural mail 
carrier, was found in his car on the Elkton Highway south of Pulaski at 8 
o'clock Saturday morning.<br>
Sheriff Gordon Topp said two hours after the discovery that Cole, who suffered a 
paralytic stroke two years ago, apparently was the victim of another seizure.<br>
The sheriff's office was informed of the death by a resident of the community 
where the body was found. A search ahd been started for Cole by his family after 
his failure to return home from a meeting he attended Friday night in 
Lawrenceburg.<br>
Cole was a member of the Church of Christ and the IOOF Lodge.<br>
Surviving are his wife, three children, George W., Mary Anne and Clara Reed 
Cole, Pulaski; five sisters, Miss Beulah Cole, Pulaski, Mrs. Russell Gilbert, 
Akron, Ohio, Mrs. Ray Davis, Lawrenceburg, Mrs. Anna Daniels, Prospect, and Mrs.

In young manhood, Mr. Collins married Miss Ella Josephine Loyd, of the large 
Loyd family between Elkton and Bryson. To the family were born two sons, Wilson 
and Clifford. Both developed into fine types of American manhood. Wilson as a 
school boy became a noted athlete. Through college he maintained his reputation. 
And after graduating became a popular coach, first at the University of 
Tennessee, then at Knoxville High. His death some two years ago, was a great 
blow to his aged father. The other son, Clifford, became a clerk in Loyd's Drug 
Store, and later one of the proprietors, where he is a popular business man, in 
the prime of life.<br>
Mr. Collins was a member of the Methodist Church, from early life. He had one 
accomplishment of which the general public knew little. He was a skillful 
violinist. And kept up his music until well beyond eighty. He did not play for 
the public but for his own love of music and the violin. Usually in the evening, 
as the shadows deepened, after supper, he would get out his violin, and for an 
hour or two would pour forth his soul in the soft, mellow notes of the violin.<br>

Mrs. Anna Birdsong and Mrs. W. M. Oliver, and a half-brother, Dr. Porter

<br>
It is not known that the young officer had not been out of the United States for 
many days, as his last letter to his parents, written in San Francisco, bore the 
date of June 21. Because of that, hope existed that a mistake had been made in 
the tragic news of the telegram, but it was blasted by the official letter 
Wednesday.<br>
Young Dotson, one of the outstanding boys in Giles County, was a member of the 
1940 graduating class at Giles County High School and had finished his pre-law 
course at Cumberland University, Lebanon. During his years at both schools, he 
had taken an active part in different phases of school work, especially in the 
realm of public speaking.<br>
At the close of his sophomore year at Cumberland, the young man answered the 
call of his country by volunteering for service in the Air Corps, and had been 
in training in California and Arizona until he left for foreign service a few 
short weeks ago.<br>
In the death of Lt. Dotson, Giles County has suffered the loss of one of its 
finest young men and has again been brought face to face with the grim reality 
of war that demands the flower of the nation's manhood.<br>
Heartfelt sympathy is extended the grief-stricken parents, whose only son made 
the supreme sacrifice that the nation might live.<br>
The Pulaski Citizen 6 Dec 1944<br>
Among the first Giles County boys serving in the U. S. Air Corps to give his 
life for his country was Second Lieut. Richard Eugene Dotson, Jr., 22 year old 
son of Mr. and Mrs. R. E. Dotson of Pulaski, who was killed in an airplane 
accident July 5, 1943, somewhere in Australia.<br>
Born an reared in Pulaski, young Dotson was a member of the 1940 graduating 
class of Giles County High School. Throughout the years spent in that school he 
was a leader in class work and in public speaking, having received as president 
of the Senior High Dramatic Club in the years 1939 and 1940.<br>
Following his graduation from high school, the young man entered the law 
department of Cumberland University, Lebanon, at the beginning of the fall term 
in 1940. Here he continued his interest in public speaking and was selected as a 
member of the University Debating Team to compete with speakers in the states of 
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.<br>
In 1942, he volunteered for service in the Air Corps and was sent to Santa Ana, 
Calif., for basic training. Later he received training at Palm Dale, Mercer and 
Glendale, Calif., and at Chandler, Ariz., where he was awarded his pilot's wings 
a short time before he was sent overseas in June, 1943.<br>
Only a few weeks later-July 5-the tragic message of the young flier's death was 
received by his parents, and sometime afterwards a letter came from a friend of 
young Dotson's telling of the beautiful and touching service that marked the 
burial of their son on that foreign soil.<br>
A member of the Methodist Church, Dick Dotson was among the leaders in the young 
people's work and a regular and faithful attendant at all Church services. In 
his death, the Church and the town sustained an irreparable loss.<br>

died at Vanderbilt Hospital, Nashville, Saturday evening at 5 o'clock, following 
a second operation for a tumor on the brain.<br>
Billie was taken to the Hospital Monday for examination. And it was decided that 
an operation gave the only hope. He under went the first operation Thursday. But 
the shock was so severe, and so long time was necessary to complete the 
operation, that it was decided best to let him rest awhile. Saturday afternoon 
he was placed under the anesthetic a second to complete the operation. But the 
shock was too much for him. He did not recover consciousness.<br>
Billie was 18, a graduate of the Pulaski High School, and had spent one year at 
the University of Tennessee. He was an unusually bright boy, made high grades at 
school, was a leader among the boys of his age, and was a good musician, a

HARDIMAN, W. W. The Pulaski Citizen 24 Dec 1941<br>
News was received Tuesday about 1:00 o'clock that W. W. Hardiman, of Pulaski, 
prominent coal dealer and owner of the Elkton Cotton Gin, had died at a 
Nashville Hospital where he had been about ten days.<br>
Some two weeks ago Mr. Hardiman sustained a second stroke of paralysis, and on 
advice of his local physician went to the Hospital for treatment. Then three or 
four days ago, it was reported taht he had developed pneumonia. So the 
announcement of his death, while it comes as a great shock to his many friends, 
is no great surprise to those who knew his condition.<br>
Monroe Bennett and A. D. Ball, went to Nashville for the remains. But at time of 
going to press, no announcement of funeral plans had been made. The burial will 
be in Pulaski where Mr. Hardiman has a lot adjoining that on which his grandson 
was buried several months ago.<br>
Mr. Hardiman did many acts of kindness and charity of which only a few of his 
more intimate friends knew anything. Like most of us, he was probably 
misunderstood by more people than knew him. And he cared more about a clear 
conscience than popularity.<br>
Mr. Hardiman is survived by two sons, Otis Hardiman, of Nashville; and W. H. 
Hardiman, of Tullahoma; and several grandchildren.<br>

HARWELL, Ermon S. The Pulaski Citizen 27 Nov 1940<br>
Inexpressibly sad was the death of Ermon Harwell on November 21, 1940. At the 
age of 45, when life was so full of hope and happiness, why should one so useful 
and worth while be called away, leaving the hearts of loved ones crushed and 
bleeding? Truly his sun went down while it was yet day, for scarcely had he come 
to the meridian of life. The passing of this highly esteemed citizen opens the 
fountain of sympathy in the hearts of many friends, in this time of great 
sorrow, leaving the home desolate, and the sweetest hopes forever withered.<br>
Born and reared in the Frankewing community, he taught school for a short period 
of time, later buying a farm and farming until his present position, as 
assistant cashier of the Bank of Frankewing. He had served as Justice of the 
Peace for the 10th Civil District since 1936 and had made the court an honorable 
and conscientious member, always attesting for the right.<br>
Ermon gave himself to the Lord early in life and was a simple trusting child of 
God. Word's but feebly express the beauty of his character. It was a privilege 
to know him here, it will be a benediction to meet him in eternity.<br>
He died of an incurable malady of the spine. For more than a year he battled 
bravely with death, suffering the any agonies peculiar to his complaint, but 
like Job of old, he was true to God. He had a cheerful disposition and wore a 
smile all through life that never faded.<br>
Funeral services were conducted Friday morning at 11 o'clock at Mt. Zion Church 
by the Rev. Vance Park and his body was laid to rest in the Wright Cemetery, 
beneath a mound of lovely flowers, attesting the loyalty of his many friends.<br>
Surviving are his wife, Aileen Arney Harwell, his father and mother, Mr. and 
Mrs. Walter Harwell and three brothers and four sisters.<br>
To the dear wife and to the bereaved family, I commend you to Him who hath said, 
&quot;There shall be no more death, neither sorrow,&quot; and may you find great comfort 
in the presence of Him who said, &quot;Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it 
be afraid.&quot; Mrs. F. R. Edmundson<br>

JONES, James Llewellyn &quot;Lew &quot; The Pulaski Citizen 4 Sep 1940<br>
Lew Jones, well-known and much beloved citizen of Pulaski, entered final sleep 
about 10:30 o'clock Saturday night, age 75.<br>
Lew Jones came of pioneer stock. His father was a scholarly man and in his young 
manhood was a teacher in Giles College. Later he became a Justice of the Peace 
and was for some time Chairman of the County Court. He was the first County 
Judge, and served in that capacity for several years.<br>
Lew was well educated, especially in English and literature. And as a young man 
he became assistant Postmaster and did most of the work. In that capacity he 
became personally acquainted with practically every person in and near Pulaski, 
an acquaintance which he kept up and extended, as the youngsters came on, and 
strangers came in. Probably no other man in the community knew personally so 
many people in the Seventh District, as he, white and black, rich and poor.<br>
About forty years ago, the editor of the Citizen needed an assistant news 
reporter and office man. Some one suggested Lew Jones, and the result of an 
interview, was association in the business, which has continued with only slight 
interruptions, to the end.<br>
A few years later the Nashville Banner, wanted a local reporter. Mr. Romine 
recommended Lew Jones, and he was engaged, and continued local reporter for the 
Banner for thirty-five years, and was recognized as one of the best in the 
state.<br>
A little later he was elected Corporation Justice of the Peace, and for several 
years held three jobs at one time. His with with the Citizen, with the Banner, 
and as Justice of the Peace.<br>
About twenty-two years ago, he became a candidate for the office of City 
Recorder, which in addition to keeping records of the Board Meetings, carried 
with it the duties of City Treasurer and Judge of the Police Court. That office 
has been his life work since.<br>
It is proper to state that he never undertook a political venture with out 
discussion and mutual understanding with the editor. And when he gave up his 
work with the Citizen, it was with the understanding he might return if he 
wanted to. He enjoyed his newspaper work. And as much for the pleasure it 
afforded, as the pay he received for it, he kept up his special column of 
personal and local items, almost every week. He carried a key to Citizen Office 
to the last. And at any time, day or night, or Sunday, was welcome to come in., 
read the exchanges, prepare copy, and generally make himself at home. We knew, 
and loved, trusted and understood each other like brothers. And while others 
will miss his wholesome passages, no one will miss his contributions to the 
Citizen, as the editor will.<br>
<br>
In young manhood he met and won Miss Lucille Pack, who made a congenial 
companion. They loved the same things, and each was devoted to the other. The 
raised two brilliant daughters. After completing such educational advantages as 
were offered in Pulaski, they completed A. B. courses at Peabody College. Then 
they went to Columbia College, and took their A.M. Degrees there. And for 
several years have maintained themselves in congenial literary surroundings, as 
coaches, and literary assistants to students who need assistance, and have means 
to pay for it.<br>
Mr. Jones had a beautiful tenor voice, and in the home with brothers and 
sisters, or occasionally in a barber-shop chorus, he would sing the melodies 
which were popular in the 80's and 90's. But he was timid about singing in 
public.<br>
The only survivors of the immediate family now here, are his wife, and his 
sister, Mrs. Buford Short. The two daughters, Misses Lucile and Lynette, live in 
New York. There are several nieces and nephews, none of whom live here.<br>
An impressive funeral service was held at the Methodist Church of which he had 
long been a constant member., Monday afternoon at 3:00 o'clock. A wealth of 
beautiful florals indicated the esteem in which he was held. A male quartette of 
good voices sang some of his old-time favorites. And Mr. Bratcher, the pastor, 
and Dr. Morgan, former pastor, conducted the simple service which might have met 
his approval, if he had planned the program.<br>
At the Cemetery, the Junior Order, of which he had long been a member, conducted 
the burial service according to the ritual of the order.<br>
Farewell brother. We commend thee to the loving kindness and tender mercies of 
the Just and Wise Judge, who will pass final judgement on the things written in 
the book of life.<br>

After lingering in the shadow s for about a year, Mrs. G. A. Morgan passed away 
at the Pulaski Hospital , Friday night, peacefully and gently, as a babe going 
to sleep. There was no struggle or gasping. The tired heart simply ceased its 
feeble breathing ceased and the spirit in the frail body to join the hosts of 
those who dwell with the immortals.<br>
Mrs. Morgan was before marriage Miss Effie Kennedy of Cornersville, a sister of 
the late Rev. M. S. Kennedy, so long the beloved past of the Pulaski 
Presbyterian Church. As a young woman she met, and later married the Rev. G. A. 
Morgan, a young Methodist preacher, who was at the time stationed near her 
father's home.<br>
She made an ideal preacher's wife. Always accepted with a murmur or complaint 
whatever assignment came to her husband. And entered actively into the work with 
him. She was an active worker, and a leader in the Missionary Society, as her 
husband was with the congregation.<br>
One son was born to them, George A. Morgan, Jr. And it was the ambition of each 
of his parents to give him even better opportunities than they enjoyed, although 
each had enjoyed the benefits of a good education.<br>
When Dr. Morgan was President of Martin College, Mrs. Morgan was his chief 
assistant. Even when he had occasion to be away from the College for a few days, 
the work went on smoothly under her guidance.<br>
Funeral services were held Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock at the Methodist 
Church, Rev. S. R. Bratcher, pastor in charge, assisted by Rev. Cullen T. 
Carter, District Superintendent, officating. In keeping with Mrs. Morgan's 
wishes, the service was short and simple.<br>
A wealth of beautiful florals gave evidence of the high esteem in which the good 
woman was held.<br>
Burial was on the family lot at Cornersville. This too was Mrs. Morgan's wish.<br>
The large auditorium was filled to capacity, not only local friends of the 
family, but also relatives and friends from other communities. And a number of 
preacher friends of both Mr. and Mrs. Morgan who came to pay a final tribute of

NIX, Robert The Pulaski Citizen 17 Jul 1940<br>
Robert Nix of the Blue Creek community killed his wife and himself sometime 
about 10 o'clock, at their home, Sunday night.<br>
According to Sheriff Joe Henry, and Deputy Keltner, who visited the scene, it 
appears that Mr. Nix struck his wife probably with the breach end of a double 
barrel shot gun. The blow apparently broke the gun stock. Then the enraged man 
beat the head of the woman with the heavy gun barrel, till the head was beaten 
almost to pulp.<br>
At sometime, probably after Mrs. Nix was killed, Mr. Nix went to a neighbor's, 
and asked to borrow a gun and some shells, saying something had been after his 
chickens. He took the gun and three shells.<br>
He left two notes, for his daughter who had gone to Lewisburg to visit her 
sister. One note was left on the front porch with a lamp. This told the young 
lady not to come in without help. The other note, left in the house gave 
direction about where to bury the bodies. Having completed plans, Mr. Nix 
apparently placed the muzzle of the loaded gun to his forehead, and pulled the 
trigger, blowing off the whole top of his head.<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Nix were well to do farm people. They had raised a family of five 
daughters and two sons. One of the sons died a few years ago, one is a truck 
driver, and four of the daughters are married. The youngest daughter was living 
at home with her parents.<br>
It is reported that during the last few years, relations between Mr. and Mrs. 
Nix, had not been agreeable. Some six months ago, Mrs. Nix left home, and later 
filed suit for divorce. But before the case came up for trial, some of the 
children intervened, and Mr. and Mrs. Nix agreed to make up, and the divorce 
proceeding was dismissed. The appeared to be getting along satisfactorily. And 
probably no one will ever know what precipitated the trouble.<br>

devoted wife and mother, the light and life of the home through the many years.

duration and which she bore with patience comforted by the faith and hope that 
had been her strength through a long useful life. She loved the church and was 
interested in its welfare. The community has lost a noble, useful citizen; the 
church a loyal member, but the loss in the home is greater than all. She had 
given more than fifty years to her home and family but is there no longer to 
welcome the children with a smile to the home they loved so dearly nor is she 
there to cheer them on their way.<br>

PAYSINGER, Hattie Chuck &quot;H. C.&quot; The Pulaski Citizen 17 Jul 1940<br>
In the passing of H. C. Paysinger, Wednesday night, July 10, the editor has lost 
more than a friend. For twenty years Mr. Paysinger had been a correspondent of 
the Citizen under the pen name Sparks Knocker from Crack Hill. He missed few 
issues of the Citizen. And in recent years, he was a frequent visitor of the 
Citizen Office. He was a genial comrade and co-worker, interested in the 
Citizen, and all the force.<br>
He not only reported the local news of the community in which he lived. But 
would report important happenings from the Bryson and Bunker Hill communities, 
of other reporters overlooked such items.<br>
A vein of quaint humor ran through all his writings. And we do not know how many 
subscribers took the Citizen, just for the sake of his comment on various 
subjects. Some of these lived even beyond the borders of Tennessee. Had no 
special interest in local news. But enjoyed Mr. Paysinger's quaint humor.<br>
<br>
Mr. Paysinger came by his names in an unusual way. When a baby, he was not named 
at once. His father and mother talked about a name for the baby, but did not 
agree on any of the family names. When the baby was a month or so old, the 
father was in a store in town one day, when a bright little girl came in, and 
the merchant said, &quot;Good morning, Hattie.&quot; Mr. Paysinger was impressed by the 
name, and good manners of the little girl. So when he returned home, he told the 
mother he had a name for the baby. The mother agreed, and so the first name 
became &quot;Hattie.&quot; The mother died when Mr. Paysinger was only about two years 
old. His father worked at the mill on Elk River. And soon the little boy was 
playing about the mill. And became a great favorite with the mill people. One of 
these was a good natured Irishman who took much interest in the little boy. When 
Hattie was about eight years old, had learned to swim and fish, one day he had 
two fish hooks set out, and was playing about. His Irish friend observed the boy 
had gotten out of sight of his fishing, and for a joke, picked up a red-headed 
woodpecker that some one had killed, and hooked on one of the fish hooks, 
replacing the fishing pole about as it had been left.<br>
When the little boy thought of his fishing, he ran up to see if he had caught 
anything. And when he pulled up the bird, instead of a fish, the Irishman was 
watching, called out, &quot;The boy has caught a woodchuck.&quot; Other people, joined in 
fun, calling the little boy, Wood Chuck. In a little while the &quot;Wood&quot; was 
dropped, and the boy acquired his second name. He was called by friends, 
sometimes Hattie, at other times, Chuck. When he became a man he accepted both 
names and signed himself, H. C. Paysinger. He married as a young man, and raised 
a fine family of boys and girls, all of whom survive.<br>
We shall miss Mr. Paysinger. Not only the editor, the office force, and his 
family and friends, his church and Sunday School, will miss him. Also, hundreds 
of people who never knew him personally, will miss his good natured, good 
humored comments.<br>

WALLACE, Rufus J. The Pulaski Citizen 25 Dec 1940<br>
Rufus J. Wallace, son of J. G. Wallace, both of whom lived near the Pleasant 
Hill Methodist Church in District Number 1, met instant death, being struck by a 
through freight train, at Ardmore Monday, December 16.<br>
Mr. Wallace had gone to Ardmore on business and parked his car on the west side 
of the Depot. Having finished his business, he apparently started back to his 
car, and had to cross the railroad and siding. His pocket knife, pipe and 
tobacco were found near the body, so it is supposed he was cleaning his pipe, 
preparing to fill and light it, before getting in the car. One train, going 
north had been side-tracked to permit the fast freight, going south to pass. The 
cotton gin, running near the depot, was making some noise, and Mr. Wallace whose 
hearing at times was not good, apparently noticed the standing train, passed in 
front of it, facing a strong wind blowing from the west, and occupied with his 
pipe and tobacco, did not notice the train comng from the north. However it 
happened, he was struck by the passing train, and instantly killed. It is 
doubtful if he was seen by either engineer or fireman. And if he had been seen, 
it would probably have been too late to stop the heavy train which was running 
fast.<br>
Funeral services were held at Pleasant Hill Church, of which Mr. Wallace was a 
member, and a member of the official board, Wednesday afternoon. Services were 
conducted by Rev. J. W. Swann, his pastor assisted by Rev. Sexton, the Baptist 
preacher at Ardmore.<br>
Burial was at the Elliott graveyard, where his mother was buried.<br>
Mr. Wallace is survived by his wife, and three children, two boys and a little 
girl. And by his aged father, J. G. Wallace. All of whom have much sympathy in 
this shocking bereavement.<br>

the Hospital, in Pulaski where he lingered without regaining consciousness to
