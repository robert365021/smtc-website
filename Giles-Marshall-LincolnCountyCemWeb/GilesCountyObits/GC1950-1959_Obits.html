DUGGER, Leon and Harold HUGHES The Pulaski Citizen 19 Nov 1958<br>
Tragedy struck a double blow in Giles County Saturday night, November 15, when 
Leon Dugger, 38, owner of Dugger's Garage, and Harold Hughes, 30, a Pulaski 
truck driver were killed in a plane crash at Warrior, Alabama.<br>
The two men were killed instantly when their flaming light plane crashed into 
Hayden Mountain in Jefferson County, Ala., early Saturday night. Wreckage of the 
plane was scattered over a wide area. A billfold bearing the name of Hughes was 
found in the debris near the two bodies.<br>
At Warrior Sunday H. W. Clapsaddle, district aviation safety officer for Civil 
Aeronautics administration, studied the wreckage and said he was unable to reach 
any conclusion why the plane crashed. He said the single engine plance had 
barely cleared the crest of a ridge before the crash. &quot;We don't know just what 
the burning of the plane before the crash had to do with the crash itself,&quot; 
Clapsaddle said.<br>
The Pulaski men were returning to Pulaski from Montgomery, where they had taken 
a young Columbia Military Academy student, Jimmy Kelley of Mt. Pleasant to 
Montgomery, Ala. to a horse show where he was to ride. He remained in 
Montgomery.<br>
Dugger, who operated a flying service in Pulaski in his spare time, was believed 
to be the pilot.<br>
Mrs. Herman Thomas, who lives near the scene of the crash, said the plane flew 
so low over her home that &quot;it sounded like it was in the house.&quot; She said the 
plane &quot;blazed up just like an explosion, but not so loud. We saw a lot of 
sparks.&quot;<br>
Witnesses said the plane was burning when it hit the mountain.<br>

Pulaski, Tenn.- William Earlie Hardiman, 49, Giles County farmer, was found dead 
on a gravel bar in Leatherwood Creek abour four miles east of here yesterday.<br>
Law enforcement officials said they believe he fell into the icy water from a 
footlog Wednesday night, suffering a head injury, and died of exposure.<br>
The body was discovered about 11:30 a. m. by the victim's wife, Virginia, who 
began searching for him after seeing his truck and hunting dog on a road near 
the creek.<br>
Mrs. Haridman said her husband went hunting Wednesday night. She was not alarmed 
when he had not returned early yesterday because he frequently hunted all night.<br>
The body was beneath the footlog and was submerged below the waist. A flashlight 
was still clutched in the victim's hand.<br>
Deputy Sheriff James Newton said Hardiman had suffered a head injury, apparently 
in the fall from the footlog, but that death probably resulted from exposure.

might be groans Wednesday night and went outside to investigate. But he returned
