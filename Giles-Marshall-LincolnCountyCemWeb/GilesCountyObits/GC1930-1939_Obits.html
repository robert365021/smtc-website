Confederate Veteran Dies<br>
Al E. Abernathy died at his home in Pulaski Friday morning of heart trouble 
after an illness of a week or two, though he had been in failing health for the 
past year. A glowing funeral tribute was paid him by the Rev. A. J. Morgan at 
the residence, Saturday morning and the interment was at Maplewood Cemetery.<br>
Mr. Abernathy was one of Giles County's best citizens and was in the 88th year 
of his age. His life was one of honorable characteristics and usefulness, for 
the most part spent in farming.<br>
Seventy-one years ago, when a mere youth, he entered the Confederate service as 
a member of Capt. Hiram Hunnicutt's Company of First Tennessee Infantry and 
served with credit during the war.<br>
Of bright and retentive mind he was a great reader and relater of war anecdotes 
and reminiscences and attended many of the State and general reunions, as well 
as the reunions of the survivors of the companies of Capts. Barber and Hunnicutt, 
in Giles and adjoining counties.<br>
Mr. Abernathy's wife formerly Miss Luticia Loyd, preceded him to the Beyond a 
number of years ago, and surviving him are three children, Mrs. Beatrice Holland 
of Knoxville, and Mrs. Mildred Worley and Homer Abernathy of Pulaski.<br>

Mrs. Almeda Mitchell Abernathy died about 9 o'clock Friday night at her home on 
South First Street after a paralytic stroke she suffered sometime Tuesday

Daughters of the Confederacy and in younger years took active interest in civic 
affairs and local charity plays and was an actress and mimic of more than 
ordinary ability. She was about 78 years of age and widow of Dr. W. D. 
Abernathy, for many years County Health Officer, who abated the smallpox 
epidemic in Giles County many years ago. Mrs. Abernathy is survived by a son, 
Mitchell Abernathy. She will be missed by her friends.<br>
<br>
ABERNATHY, Blanche Stephens The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 24 Jan 1934<br>
It was with sad hearts we heard last Friday afternoon that Mrs. Colston 
Abernathy and her infant son had passed away at the Pulaski Hospital. All that 
skilled hands and loving hearts could do could not stay the hand of death. Mrs. 
Abernathy was truly a lovable character, a devoted wife, an affectionate mother, 
a kind neighbor.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Abernathy was formerly Miss Blanche Stephens of Princeton, Ky. In early 
life she joined the Baptist Church of which she has been a faithful member. 
Twenty-one years ago she was married to Mr. Abernathy. She is survived by her 
husband and the following children: Kathleen, Martha, Colston, Dudley, Georgia, 
Ann, Moulton, Alex, Virginia and Nancy. She is also survived by her mother Mrs. 
Martha Stephens, one sister, Mrs. J.L. Vinson, five brothers, Hershel, J. D., 
Sam and Rice, all of Princeton and Wendell Stephens of Florida. Two 
half-brothers, John and George Stephens of Princeton also survive.<br>
Funeral services were conducted at the residence Sunday afternoon by Rev. C.E. 
Patch of the Baptist Church at Pulaski, followed by interment at Maplewood.<br>
Those who came from a distance were J. D., Sam, Hershel, John and George 
Stephens and Mr. and Mrs. J.T. Vinson all of Princeton, Miss. Corrine Townsend, 
Mr. and Mrs. L.T. Webster and her sister, and James Webster all of Evansville, 
Ind., Mr. and Mrs. Flecher Abernathy, Misses Eleanor and Grace Abernathy of

<br>
ABERNATHY, Erskine The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 17 Apr 1935<br>
Erskine Abernathy, a good farmer and fruit grower, living in the 11th District, 
north-east of Pulaski, was found in a dying condition early Sunday morning. 
Circumstances were such that it is not possible to state definitely whether it 
was a case of accidental death, murder, or suicide.<br>
Chicken thieves had been stealing Mrs. Abernathy's chickens, and on retiring 
Saturday night Mr. Abernathy was observed to place a pistol under his pillow. 
When Mrs. Abernathy asked about it, Mr. Abernathy said he was tired seeing her 
worry in caring for her little chicks, and then have them all stolen when large 
enough to use.<br>
Mrs. Abernathy was not aroused during the night, and when she awakened Sunday 
morning and saw Mr. Abernathy's bed vacant, she supposed he had gone out to the 
barn to look after the feeding. A neighbor came in to see about borrowing a 
saddle, and Mrs. Abernathy told him to see Mr. Abernathy at the barn. Starting 
to the barn the body of Mr. Abernathy was discovered slumped over a chicken wire 
coop.<br>
A bullet had entered the head on the right side, about two inches above the ear, 
and had passed clear through the head, passing out the left side almost on a 
level with the point of entrance. There was no powder burn such as usually 
accompanies a shot at close range. Mr. Abernathy's pistol was on the ground at a 
little distance, with one empty chamber. He was not quite dead, but was 
unconscious and died in just a little while after the body was discovered.<br>
There are no known facts. No occasion for suicide is known.<br>
It is possible Mr. Abernathy may have been watching for the thief about the 
chicken house, and failed to notice the chicken coop until he stumbled and fell 
over it. And the pistol may have been discharged, the bullet, by chance, 
striking as it did. Or it is possible, he may have been shot by one of the 
thieves and fired his pistol, involuntarily, or may have shot first, and the 
thief returned the fire with fatal results.<br>
Or it is possible the shot may have been fired with suicidal intent. But the 
absence of a known cause, also the absence of powder burns, make this the least 
probable possibility.<br>
The theory of accidental death was so generally accepted by those in best 
position to know the facts that no one would make the necessary affidavits to 
hold an inquest. So none was held.<br>
After funeral services at the home, Monday morning at 10:30 the body was laid to 
rest in Maplewood Cemetery at Pulaski.<br>
<br>
ABERNATHY, &quot;Fed&quot; The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 10 Aug 1932<br>
Died August 5, 1932, age 83 years. Thus passes from the stage of the pioneers of 
our county; while &quot;Fed&quot; was not as old as some of the other residents, he was 
connected with the past as perhaps no other man in Giles County. Fed and his 
father, Elisha Abernathy lived in a large part of three centuries-the latter 
part of 1700-all of 1800 and 32 years of 1900.<br>
&quot;Fed's&quot; father, Elisha, my father's grandfather, Jimmy &quot;Dry&quot; Abernathy, Turner 
Abernathy, and John H. Birdsong, came to this country from North Carolina about 
1816. All of them settled in the cane brakes about four miles east of Tarpley 
Shop on what is now the old stage road, each one at a large spring. &quot;Fed&quot; owned 
at his death part of this original tract of land.<br>
Most of the original tracts of land where these pioneers settled are still in 
the hands of the families who inherited them.<br>
Much could be written about this one branch of the Abernathy family provided 
your paper could contain it.<br>
Suffice to say Frederick Abernathy was my great-great-grandfather. He had 
several childen, one of whom was Jimmy &quot;Dry&quot; Abernathy, my great-grandfather. 
Jimmy &quot;Dry&quot; had eleven children as follows: Turner Abernathy, Adline, Colston 
(Moulton's grandfather), Hardy, Elbert, Rebecca, Cape, Hartwell (my 
grandfather), John C., Levi, Sterling.<br>
Anyone interested may obtain the names, etc., of the heirs of all of the above 
named eleven children by request. All of the above information together with 
much additional information was given me by my father who is still living and 
remembers all these facts.<br>

J. Press Abernathy died suddenly at his home here Monday night after a long 
period of physical decline, and his burial took place at Maplewood Cemetery 
Tuesday afternoon after funeral services by the Rev. George Douglas.<br>
<br>
Mr. Abernathy was in the 90th year of his age and was a good citizen. For many 
years he was a leading farmer of the Conway locality, but retired from active 
work about fifteen year ago and moved to town to reside. He had for many years 
been a member of the Elkton Masonic Lodge and a member of the Methodist Church 
about 65 years. In the Civil War he was a member of the Third Tennessee Regiment 
in the Confederate cause and received a wound in the head at Jonesboro which 
injury gave him trouble at times for the remainder of his life. For a number of 
years, he was a member of the Giles County Court and made a good magistrate, 
being a man of character and honesty of purpose.<br>
Mr. Abernathy is survived by his daughter, Miss Mary Eleanor Abernathy who 
resided with him and ministered to him in his declining years. M. T. Abernathy 
of Bethesda is a surviving brother as is C. L. Abernathy of Columbia. A sister,

in New York and when the World War came on he enlisted and saw twelve months 
service overseas.<br>
He was a bright and capable man and learned telegraphy in the local Western 
Union office. He had many friends who regret his death, which is particularly 
sad as he is the third member of the family to died within about six months.<br>

Mrs. Katherine Abernathy, widow of John W. Abernathy, passed away at her home in 
the Aspen Hill section Thursday, and her burial took place Friday in the family 
burying ground after funeral rites by the Rev. J. L. Taylor.<br>
Mrs. Abernathy had reached an advanced age and her death ends a beautiful 
Christian life whose good influence will linger like a blessing and a guiding 
star to her bereft children and friends. She was a devoted member of the 
Methodist Church since her youth and in all life's relations was steadfast and 
faithful until the completion of her earthly task.<br>
Surviving Mrs. Abernathy are the following named children: Mrs. Hughey Marks, 
Moulton and Colston Abernathy, Mrs. Hobart Townsend and Mrs. Pete Webster, of 
Giles County and Fletcher Abernathy of Maury County.<br>
<br>
ABERNATHY, Liles E. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 12 Feb 1936<br>
<br>
Squire Liles E. Abernathy, Pulaski Corporation Magistrate, died at his apartment 
on the west side of the Square at 5 o'clock Wednesday morning after an illness 
dating from August 1935. Funeral services are to be conducted by the Rev. G. A. 
Morgan, at 2 o'clock Thursday at the Methodist Church, Pulaski. Burial will be 
in the Abernathy family burying ground near DeLacey Abernathy's residence.<br>
Squire Abernathy was for many years a leading livestock dealer in Giles County 
and took an interest in the promotion of livestock and farm interests. He was a 
man of firm convictions and was noted for his honesty and fair dealing in all 
his transactions in both private and official life. He was a son of Capt. James 
E. Abernathy, deceased who was fo many years a leading farmer and stockman of 
the county.<br>
Surviving Squire Abernathy are his wife formerly Miss Cunningham, and two sons,

Abernathy.<br>
His death is regretted by a wide circle of friends.<br>
<br>
ABERNATHY, Elizabeth Denty &quot;Lizzie D.&quot; The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 17 Aug 1932<br>
Miss Lizzie D. Abernathy passed away at the home of her brother, Casey 
Abernathy, about 1 o'clock Saturday.<br>
Miss Abernathy enjoyed the advantages of a good education and in early life 
became a successful school teacher. Bur recognizing the needs of the younger 
members of her father's family, and the children of the local community of 
Pleasant Valley, she abandoned the broader field and devoted her life-work to 
the needs of her home community.<br>
Not only were the children instructed, the mothers were helped with their 
problems. Long before the Government began the work of the Home Demonstration 
Agent and Cooperative Marketing, Miss Lizzie had organized a community club, and 
was conducting cooperative marketing. Indeed it is believed the germ of 
cooperative marketing which is now one of the foremost activities of the 
Government, developed in her brain. She worked unselfishly and modestly for the 
best interest of her community. And made no claims for personal recognition when 
the editors of agricultural papers, and heads of departments, called upon her 
for information about the organization and operation of a community club. She 
was always glad for others to take up the work she had inaugurated, and carry it 
forward. And she learned that she could secure greater cooperation by others 
when they were permitted to claim the credit for ideas and plans.<br>
In recent years, Miss Lizzie had devoted much time to the genealogy of the 
Abernathy family. After several years of research, she prepared a pamphlet, 
which was published by The Citizen, tracing the various branches of the Giles 
County family of Abernathys. And the distribution of this pamphlet brought much 
additional information and an extended correspondence. Only recently Miss Lizzie 
had been appointed Giles County representative of a national genealogical 
bureau, and was busily engaged in preparation for this new activity when the 
stroke came that terminated fatally.<br>
<br>
After funeral services Sunday afternoon at Pleasant Valley Church, the church 
where her active church and Sunday School work had been done over a period of 
years, the body was laid away in the family lot where repose the remains of her 
ancestors, and other members of the family. Funeral services were conducted by 
Rev. George L. Beale of Nashville for many years a friend of the family, 
assisted by Dr. R. J. Craig, a cousin, and the local pastor, Rev. W. C. 
Morehead. The church was filled to capacity and perhaps not more than half of 
those who came to the funeral gained admission. A wealth of beautiful florals 
was a further tribute to the memory of this good woman.<br>
Civilization and the Church will perhaps never recognize the debt due to 
unselfish individuals, like Miss Lizzie D., who give up those things, which make 
life dear to the average man or woman and devote their lives to unselfish 
service for the benefit of others.<br>
<br>
ABERNATHY, Mary Elizabeth The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 10 Jun 1936<br>
Death always brings a sense of sadness and loneliness into the home. But when it 
comes to one who has served the normal span of life, it is to be expected, as a 
natural incident of age. But to the young in the prime of life, it seems 
peculiarly sad.<br>
Such was the passing of Mrs. Clyde Abernathy, Saturday. She had been apparently 
well and happy, until a few weeks ago, when internal trouble developed. She went 
to Nashville Hospital for examination when it was discovered she was suffering 
from an internal cancer, and that the case was hopeless. She was brought home to 
wait for the time being. But was not informed of her true condition. 
Fortunately, under the circumstances, she die not have long to wait. The end 
came Saturday.<br>
The funeral was conducted Sunday afternoon at the home of her father and mother, 
Mr. and Mrs. Steele Thompson, Rev. G. A. Morgan officiating. Burial at 
Maplewood.<br>
Mrs. Abernathy is survived by her husband, her father and mother, a brother, Jim 
Thompson, and a sister Miss Helen Thompson, to all of whom much sympathy is 
extended.<br>

critical condition. Then Tuesday morning the message came that she had passed 
away.<br>

is possible.<br>

late R. D. &quot;Bob&quot; Abernathy, for many years a successful school teacher in Giles

ADCOCK, William E. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 14 Apr 1937<br>
Last week I announced this young man had pneumonia, but now with a trembling 
hand and sad heart, I have to say the grim messenger of death came Saturday and 
blighted his home and left a vacancy which never can be filled.<br>
His going away cast a gloom of sorrow and sadness among his young friends and 
associates, and it reached far into the hearts of the older ones.<br>
He was as loyal to the Sunday School and League as the sun is on its journey 
through the Heavens.<br>
Not because he has passed on to the great beyond I am saying this. But because 
many of his friends of his age who have been with him all the while said he was 
the choice of them all. He was always cheerful and in a jovial spirit. &quot;God 
moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform.&quot; So we submit to him who doeth 
all things well.<br>
The family has the sympathy of all their neighbors in their great loss.<br>

The negro was arrested by Sheriff Henry, later in the evening, near Booth's Ice 
Plant, and was taken to Nashville for safe keeping. There was some talk of a mob 
among friends of Brock, encouraged by strangers and loafers, wanting something 
exciting. The Sheriff discretely removed the negro to Nashville. An most of the

quick tempered fellow, especially when he has had a few drinks. Ballentine and a 
young woman started walking away from the woman's home. Her mother called after 
her, to ask where she was going. Brock who chanced to be passing, and was 
rolling a cigarette, probably in a spirit of fun siad, &quot;Yes, where are you 
going?&quot; Ballentine resented this, and told Brock this was a colored woman and 
did not concern him. After an exchange of a few words, Ballentine stabbed Brock 
and he collapsed, dying almost instantly, with his sack of tobacco still 
clutched in one hand, and his cigarette paper in the other.<br>

BROWN, John C. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 2 Dec 1936<br>
John C. Brown, only son of Governor and John C. Brown, died at a Nashville 
hospital Tuesday morning at 7:10 o'clock after an illness extending over about 
two weeks.<br>
After funeral services at Christ Church, Nashville, Wednesday morning at 9:30 
the body was conveyed to Pulaski by the Dorris Undertaking Company, for burial 
on the family lot here, where are the remains of his father and mother, and 
three sisters, and one nephew. He is the last member of his immediate family, 
and is survived by one nephew, John Brown Burch.<br>
John Brown was the baby and only son of his parents. With three sisters and 
indulgent parents and in a home of wealth, he grew up under circumstances that 
left few responsibilities for him to shoulder. He was a good student in school. 
Completed his preparatory work and took the literary and law courses at 
Vanderbilt where he graduated young in 1886. He entered upon the practice of his 
profession in Nashville. But his father died in 1889. And his mother with 
extensive business interests required most of his time and attention.<br>
The financial depression and other misfortunes came heavy upon him. And having 
passed the meridian of life in comparative ease and luxury, he was unable to 
adapt himself to changed conditions. This busy, bustling age in which we live, 
has little time or inclination to give a thought or care tot he aged and 
unfortunate.<br>
In his case, no doubt, death came as a welcome messenger. But it brings sad 
reflections to those who knew the family and his early surroundings.<br>

Mr. Brown, after fifty-five years active service as an ordained minister of the 
Presbyterian Church, retired from active service, last year. But continued quite 
active for a man of his age. He spent about a year here in the home of his son. 
But a few weeks ago, decided to return to his own home at Petersburg. His home 
was on a lot adjoining that of his daughter, Mrs. George Russell. He would take 
his meals with Mr. and Mrs. Russell, and their little family, but preferred to 
go to his own home, just next door, for rest and sleep.<br>

several miles out from Petersburg several days last week. Monday he attended a 
Presbyterial meeting at Lewisburg. Drove his own car, going and coming, and took 
an active part in the proceedings of the meeting.<br>

house most of the day. In the evening, he did not want any supper. Went over to 
his home to rest. After supper, Mr. and Mrs. Russell went across the lot to see 
how he was, and if he wanted anything. They found him lying on the bed, peaceful 
in death.<br>

practically all his active life in Middle Tennessee. He served churches in 
various communities. Was for a number of years pastor of the Presbyterian Church 
at Lynnville. One of his longest pastorates was at Fayetteville. Then he was for 
sometime at Petersburg.<br>
After funeral services in the Presbyterian Church at Petersburg Thursday, the 
body will be laid away beside that of his wife who preceded him several years 
ago, at Fayetteville. He had arranged all details of his funeral long in 
advance.<br>
Mr. Brown is survived by his son, Hutton Brown of Pulaski, and three daughters, 
Mrs. O. L. Putnam of Los Angeles, who had made plans to come in a few days for a 
visit to her father, Mrs. O.W. Pope of Oklahoma City, Okla., and Mrs. George 
Russell, who lived next door to her father's home at Petersburg. He is also 
survived by one sister, Mrs. Ella Monroe, Asheville, N. C.<br>

carried a gun. On the way home, Jones was walking behind Carruth, and Carruth 
was shot in the back of the neck. The wound was such that the body was

home with Mrs. W. R. Hunter here in Pulaski. Mrs. Hunter recently bought the C. 
C. Brown home on Third Street, and expects to come here in the early summer.<br>
Mr. Collins was not feeling quite well, and when breakfast was ready Thursday 
morning he was sleeping soundly. Breakfast was served to other members of the 
family so the children might get off to school on time. And later, when Mr. 
Collins woke up his breakfast was prepared. He spoke of not feeling like eating 
much breakfast. But came to the table. Just as he took his place at the table, 
he collapsed. And was dead in a few minutes.<br>

girls. Seven of the children survive: W. W. Collins, Mrs. W. R. Hunter, Tom 
Collins, Mrs. W. C. Dale, Drake Collins, Mrs. Sam Fox,<br>
and Mrs. Newton Reese.<br>
Mr. Collins was a consistent member of the Methodist Church, and a dependable 
citizen and buriness man. He was one of those men who made warm friendships. He 
was active in business when he retired. About the only recreation he indulged in 
was fox hunting. He enjoyed the chase, and usually kept a good pack of hounds. 
Even in the late years of his life, when too feeble to follow the hounds, he 
would frequently go out with friends, taking a camp stool with him, and 
selecting a suitable place, would sit and listen to the hounds. Ane when 
familiar with the pack, he could tell each dog as he would open up on the trail. 
He enjoyed friendly conversation and good jokes. But when the hounds were 
chasing a fox, he would sit alone, that he might enjoy undisturbed, the baying 
dogs, which made for him the sweetest music.<br>
Many hearts were made sad by his going away.<br>

How sad the hearts of a whole community can become in a very short time. Such 
was the case in this community when the news spread that Brooks Dabney had gone 
to heaven- not sad because Brooks had gone to heaven but sad because we needed

from that time has gradually weakened until on Oct. 28 she passed on to be with 
those loved ones who have already reached the Great Beyond.<br>
Miss Dabney was a member of the second graduating class of Jones School at

Mrs. T. E. Daly, widow of the late Thomas E. Daly, of Pulaski, died Sunday at

Mr. and Mrs. Daly. Mr. Daly served for a time as Mayor of Pulaski, and he was 
for some years cashier of the Peoples Bank. He was a member of the Board of 
Trust of Martin College. And was active in all social and community enterprises.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Daly, while less in the public eye, loved her home and flowers, and was a 
good wife, home maker, and church member. With no children, life has been lonely 
for her, these twenty-three years, since Mr. Daly's death.<br>

conducted by Rev. G. A. Morgan, the body was laid away in Maplewood, beside the

On Oct. 6th as the curtain of night was falling the sweet spirit of Alonzo A. 
Daniel, was winging its flight to that bright and shining city not made with 
hands. Alonzo was a good boy, a loving uncle and brother and was loved by all 
who knew him. All that loving hands and medical skill could do was done by the 
Master called and Alonzo answered the call, bade friends and loved ones 
farewell, and went to rest with loved ones gone before. After an illness of 
three years with T. B. he was laid to rest in Lynnwood Cemetery. Funeral by Rev.

DANIEL, Dorothy Lou &quot;Dallie&quot; The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 20 Jan 1937<br>
On Jan. 8th just before the dawn of morning light the death angel was winding 
its way through the portals of Pulaski Hospital, to bear on the wings of mercy 
the dear little spirit of Dorothy Lou Daniel, the darling little daughter of Mr. 
and Mrs. M. L. Daniel. Little (Dallie) as she was known by friends and loved 
ones was two years and eleven months old. The lonely parents carried their 
precious darling for an operation three weeks before her death. At first after

baby sister, Mildred Jean; two brothers, Morris and Mitchell; grandparents, Mr. 
and Mrs. Charlie Woodard of near Lynnville and a host of friends and relatives.

<br>
DANIEL, Virginia Lee Thompson The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 28 Oct 1936<br>
Mrs. Robert Daniel, mother of Dr. Sinclair Daniel, died Sunday afternoon at Dr. 
Daniel's residence on the Martin College campus, where Mrs. Daniel has lived in 
the home of her son, most of the time since the death of her husband about four 
years ago.<br>
Mrs. Daniel has been an invalid for a number of years, having suffered repeated 
strokes of paralysis. Until recently she was able to get about in a wheel chair 
most of the time. But during the last few weeks she was confined to the bed, 
practically all the time. A relative and a friend who have been in almost 
constant attendance recently were with Mrs. Daniel at the last.<br>
It was a beautiful afternoon, and her condition was not apparently different 
from what it had been several days. Mr. Daniel had gone out with a group of 
students to enjoy a drive. While they were away attendants noticed that Mrs. 
Daniel was breathing a little faster than usual. Then they noticed that her 
breathing was a little more slowly. So, just like a little child going to sleep, 
without a gasp or a struggle, she gradually ceased to breathe. An the tired 
spirit winged its flight from its earthly temple.<br>
Mrs. Daniel was seventy-two years of age, a native of Ripley, West Tennessee. 
Miss Virginia Lee Thompson, before her marriage with Robert Daniel. She is 
survived by two sons, Sinclair and Thompson, and a large family connection.<br>
The body was removed by hearse Tuesday morning to Clarksville for burial in 
Greenwood Cemetery beside the remains of her departed husband. Funeral services 
were held at the grave, conducted by the Rev. D. E. Hinkle, the new presiding 
elder of the Clarksville District, and an intimate friend of the family. Mrs. 
Daniel was a devoted member of the Methodist Church. And before illness, was a 
vivacious, brilliant lady, who made friends readily, and retained their 
friendship. As an invalid unable to enter into conversation, she has lived a 
very quiet, retire life in our community. But retained her acute memtal 
faculties almost to he end. She appreciated the kind attentions that were 
showered upon her, by the few who were near her.<br>
<br>
DARNELL, Buna Vista &quot;B. V.&quot; The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 9 Aug 1939<br>
Died at his home on South First Street, Pulaski, Thursday morning, August 3, B. 
V. Darnell, age about 84 years.<br>
Mr. Darnell had been in failing health for a long time. He had an attack of 
pneumonia last fall. And at his age was hardly expected to survive, but rallied. 
Later, he suffered an attack of heart trouble, or a slight paralytic stroke. And 
partly rallied from that. But for three or four months, has been confined to his 
bed. Not suffering much pain. But unable to get up, or to turn himself in bed 
without assistance.<br>
In his early life, Mr. Darnell was a farmer. In the winter of 1908, thirty years 
ago in December 1938, he was employed by the Board of Trustees of the Pulaski 
Cemetery, and for all these years, with few days off, as long as he was able to 
work, he has been Sexton of the Pulaski Cemetery. Since his health failed, his 
grandson, Robert Allen Downing, has carried on the work for his grandfather.<br>
Mr. Darnell was a stout, hard-working man. He believed in doing a good day's 
work for a day's pay. And insisted that men who worked for hin, do a good day's 
work or quit. He was not unkind. But was positive, and plain spoken, and had no 
patience with loafers. He did not always please the people he worked for, or 
with. No man could do that. But he tried to do his duty, as he saw it.<br>
He lived with the Cemetery and for the Cemetery, these many years. Of about six 
hundred cemetery lots, he seldom had to refer to the map to locate a lot. For 
twenty years, up to the time of his last illness he could almost always go 
direct to any lot called for, without a moment's hesitation. And when a grave 
had to be prepared, regardless of the weather, even on occasions, when two or 
three graves had to be prepared for use the same day, he always had them ready 
on time. Perhaps none of us can remember when we had to wait for a grave to be 
finished, since Mr. Darnell became Sexton.<br>
Mr. Darnell came of a devout Methodist family. One of his brothers was a 
Methodist preacher. And B. V. united with the church as a boy, and lived a 
faithful member to the end.<br>
He is survived by one daughter, and three grandchildren.<br>
After funeral services at the home, Friday afternoon at 3 o'clock, conducted by 
his pastor, Dr. Morgan, the body was laid away in the cemetery where he had 
worked so long, and which he loved almost as a member of the family, beside the 
remains of his wife, who preceded him some four or five years.<br>
<br>
DARNELL, Mary Frances Hulsey The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 3 Nov 1937<br>
Mrs. B. V. Darnell died at her home on South First Street, Pulaski, Thursday, 
about 11 o'clock. After funeral services at the home, Friday afternoon at 2 
o'clock, conducted by her pastor, Rev. G. A. Morgan, the body was laid to rest 
in Maplewood Cemetery.<br>
Mrs. Darnell had reached the advanced age of 85. In recent years she had been an 
invalid. Feeble in health and almost blind. But she will be none the less missed 
in the home where she was tenderly cared for by her husband, her daughter, and 
grandchildren. She had been a faithful member of the Methodist Church from 
childhood. And after her health failed, so she could not attend regular services 
at the church, she still greatly appreciated the pastoral visits of the 
preacher. If he did not suggest it on such occassions, she always requested him, 
to read a Bible lesson and have a prayer service with her.<br>
Peace to her memory, and to the surviving members of the family.<br>
<br>

brothers and sisters, including Rebecca Davis, teacher in Tuskegee Institute, 
Ollie May, who teaches in West Tennessee, Clarence of Chicago, Otis B. of New 
York, and Cleophus, who lives in California.<br>
Selah was janitor at the Peoples Bank for many years and at the Presbyterian

was cornetist in the colored bands here. He was popular with both races and his 
friends regret his unexpected death.<br>

EDMUNDSON, Cornelia J. Hardy The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 15 Apr 1931<br>
Many hearts were made sad to hear of the death of Mrs. Elihu Edmundson. I have 
known her for many years, we were school and classmates when we were girls. Dr. 
Gardner and Mrs. Fannie Brown taught in the old Methodist Church at Bethel in 
those days.<br>
&quot;One of our friends depart,<br>
Who has not lost a friend?&quot;<br>
She had many good qualities, but she was of quick temper, and would say 
something at school that she would be sorry for and the next day she would put 
her arms around us and make confession. Then we would love her more. Her 
kindness made us better girls.<br>
I always visited her when at Bethel with my kins people. On last summer we were 
going to the church and she said we will not live much longer to go to church 
together. I am too feeble. I told her that we had the great Omnipresent and 
Omniscient Being with us, and we could have Him for our companion where ever we 
were. And the tears ran down her cheeks.<br>
We sympathize with the bereaved. May they look on the bright side of life for 
God is good and merciful. Mrs. Lydia Anna Phelps.<br>

HICKMAN, Carl D. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 22 Sep 1937<br>
Not only the family, but the entire community, was shocked, late Wednesday 
afternoon, when a message came that Highway Patrolman Carl D. Hickman, had been 
killed in a collision between his motorcycle and a school bus, on the Highway 
between Chattanooga, Athens, Tenn.<br>
<br>
Mr. Hickman who had been in the Highway Patrol service, about seven years, and 
all these years, stationed at Pulaski, had just been transferred to Athens, 
McMinn County, on the Highway between Chattanooga and Knoxville. He hated to 
leave home and friends for the new assignment, but obedient to orders of his 
superiors, he started Tuesday, as we reported in the Citizen last week. It is 
said he expected to meet the District Chief at Chattanooga, and remained there 
till afternoon Wednesday. Then started on to Athens in company with W. H. 
Winfrey, another Patrolman, who had been assigned to the same territory.<br>
It is said they were going about fifty to fifty-five miles an hour when they 
came up behind a school bus, the driver gave the signal that he was going to 
turn out, but evidently Mr. Hickman failed to see the hand. The school bus 
turned to the left, across the highway, just in front of the patrolman. And 
Hickman crashed into the bus, about the rear wheel.<br>
Winfrey saw the bus driver's signal, and barely succeeded in passing the bus. He 
ran on fifty to seventy-five yards, before he could stop his motorcycle. 
Returning, he found Hickman, dead on the Highway. His motorcycle was completely 
wrecked, and the tire of the school bus, where it was struck, was wrecked. Only 
five children were on the bus at the time, others having been left at their 
homes. These and the driver escaped injury.<br>
Two State Revenue men happened to come by on their way to Chattanooga, just at 
the time, and they rushed Mr. Hickman's body to a Hospital, as quickly as 
possible, but he was dead on examination at the hospital.<br>
Mr. Winfrey reported to his District Chief, and he in turn reported to the State 
Chief at Nashville, who called Dr. W. W. Martin to break the news to Mrs. 
Hickman.<br>
Arrangements were quickly made for the Undertaker at Chattanooga to embalm the 
body, and Bennett-May and Company, went for it with an ambulance. They were 
accompanied by Mr. Patterson and a committee of Masons, Aubrey Hagan, Master of 
the Lodge, G. B. Abernathy, Treasurer, and Stokley Nelson. Returning they 
reached Pulaski about 2 o'clock Thursday morning.<br>
Funeral services were held at the Episcopal Church Friday afternoon at the 
Episcopal Church, Friday afternoon at 3 o'clock, Rev. Thomas F. Thrasher, rector 
of St. Peters Church, Columbia, officiating. Members of the Highway Patrol, 
served as pall bearers, and as an escort of honor to the cemetery. The Masonic 
Lodge assembled at the grave and conducted the ritualistic burial service.<br>
Mr. Hickman was a member of the Episcopal Church, and a vestryman. He was a 
Mason, Senior Warden, of his home lodge, a member of the Scottish Rite 
Consistory, and of the Shrine. He was a man who made friends, and retained them.<br>
He is survived by his wife, who was before marriage, Miss Josephine Patterson, 
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Joe Patterson, Jr., and by his little daughter, Mary Jo 
Hickman. Also his mother, Mrs. W. B. Hickman.<br>

JUSTICE, Frank C. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 4 Jan 1938<br>
Frank C. Justice, one of the best and most successful farmers in the county, was 
attacked by a bull in his barn on the Highway, just south of Milky Way Farms, 
Sunday forenoon, and was so seriously injured that he died at the Pulaski 
Hospital, Monday morning.<br>
The story as we get it is, that Mr. Justice went to the barn, some distance from 
the residence, to gather eggs. One nest was in a stall occupied by the bull. The 
animal had been gentle and apparently Mr. Justice did not anticipate any danger. 
He went into the stall with the bull and closed the door.<br>
For some unknown reason, or without reason, the bull attacked the defenseless 
man, broke the left arm, and apparently forced him against the wall, breaking 
several ribs, and crushing the body, probably causing internal injuries.<br>
Frank Thurman, cattle foreman on the Milky Way Farms, riding about looking over 
the cattle, heard Mr. Justice calling for help, and galloped down on the farm 
bridge over Richland and across the pasture, to where the fence runs near Mr. 
Justice's barn. He crossed the fence, and ran to the barn, where he took in the 
situation at a glance. He prized loose a board near the corner where Mr. Justice 
was crowded into a close place. Caught him by one leg and pulled him through the 
opening. Then hoisting him to his shoulder, set out for the residence. When more 
than half way up the hill, Mr. Justice had partly recovered and asked Mr. 
Thurman to let him down, saying he thought he could walk. And with the 
assistance of Mr. Thurman, did walk to the house.<br>
Mrs. Justice in the house, had not heard any outcry, and knew nothing of the 
trouble, till she heard the men talking as they approached the house.<br>
Mr. Justice was rushed to the Pulaski Hospital, where everything possible was 
done for him. But he passed away Monday morning.<br>
Funeral services were held at the Bennett-May and Company Funeral Home, 
Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock, Rev. J. E. Trotter, of Olivet, officiating.<br>

Pulaski Citizen March 17, 1937 In Memory of Dr. G. W. Lancaster<br>
The Pisgah Community was much saddened by the passing of Dr. Lancaster. He lived 
practically all his life at Pisgah--the little village he so greatly loved: and 
for around fifty years he practiced his profession. One cannot calculate in 
material means the inestimable good this kind Samaritan did in administering to 
the sick.<br>
He was a missionary indeed--having gone through hot and cold--much of his life's 
work was without compensation. He was not a perfect man--he had his faults, as 
you and I, but there was never a more devoted father and husband.<br>
The Doctor was a man of culture and refinement, having read and studied until 
near the end, and it made him flexible to any form of society.<br>
The people will miss this useful, kind and sympathetic man, for the services he 
rendered to all classes was great.<br>
May God bless and care for his family. Allen Aymett, Sr.<br>

He had been in ill health for some months, the result of flu which had 
undermined his health. Loved ones had been hopeful of his recovery until a few 
weeks past, when his steady decline became evident, and his painracked body 
could bear no more, he gave up the struggle, and fell asleep to awaken in 
eternity, with the saints immortal, where sickness and where dwell his sainted 
father and a precious angel baby. He left behind him the comforting assurance, 
&quot;tell mamma I've met my Saviour face to face. I'm alright, and ready if the 
summons comes.&quot;<br>
Besides his wife, and five children all of whom are grown except one, he leaves 
an angel broken hearted mother, one brother, and three sisters. Burial was in 
his home town Dayton.<br>
He lived a life of services for others, oblivious of self and the necessary care

dear one, you could not, shall not be forgotten. Sister<br>

NORWOOD, James Shelby The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 1 Nov 1939<br>
According to best information available, Walter J. Bassham of Minor Hill, shot 
and killed James Norwood, also of Minor Hill, sometime about 10 o'clock Tuesday 
night. The shooting appears to have resulted from Halloween pranking, or 
roughstuff, which has of recent years become all too common.<br>
According to reports, a masquerading party of children passed along the street 
earlier in the evening making a noise but doing no damage. Later a number of 
larger boys or young men came along, and in addition to making noises, were 
doing other things. It is said they were in Mr. Bassham's yard, doing something 
with an old buggy. A shot was fired, and James Norwood, 19, son of Shelby 
Norwood, ran down the road as far as George Sanders', where he collapsed. In a 
moment, others began calling Mr. Sanders, who had retired, telling him a man was 
shot, and asking that he help get him to a Doctor. As quickly as Mr. Sanders 
could get into some clothes, he came out, and with the assistance of his 
friends, helped young Norwood into his car, and hurried to Pulaski Hospital. On 
examination, Norwood was found to be dead. If not dead when lifted into the car 
at Sanders' front porch, he had expired on the way.<br>
It is said, Mr. Bassham, came at once to the Sheriff's office, and reported the 
shooting and surrendered. And the Sheriff, taking no chances with the Halloween 
crowd, sent a deputy with the prisoner out of the county, telling him not to 
report where he was going.<br>
Mr. Bassham, has one eye, and is crippled in one leg. A peaceable, good citizen. 
He is probably 65 or 70 years of age. And it is said the boys have annoyed him 
on former occasions on Halloween night.<br>
The unfortunate affair is regretted by friends of both parties.<br>

PORTER, R. H. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 25 Nov 1936<br>
R. H. Porter, age about 76, one of the foremost citizens and business men of 
Giles County for nearly fifty years, passed away at his home on Third Street, 
Friday evening about 9 o'clock following a heart attack which came on Thursday 
evening.<br>
Mr. Porter had been in failing health some four or five years. But was able to 
be about the Bank most of the time, till Thursday evening when a heart attack 
came and he gradually grew weaker.<br>
Mr.Porter's boyhood was at Como, Miss. As a young man he met and married Miss 
Courtney White of Pulaski, a sister of the late Jim White. T. P. Stone married 
another sister. And the three young men, all interested in live stock. organized 
the firm of Stone, Porter and White, which came to be recognized as one of the 
foremost firms of live stock dealers, not only in Giles County but throughout 
the South.<br>
There were no automobiles in those days. But good saddle horses, buggies and 
carriages, surreys, and drummers' wagons, were in great demand.<br>
Not only did the firm maintain a large livery stable, equipped with good horses 
and equipment, but conducted an extensive sales business. They handled in 
addition to horses and mules, cattle, sheep and hogs.<br>
To take care of the extensive business, the large brick building on the 
northeast corner of the square, now occupied by Reeves Drug Store, and the Ben 
Franklin Store was erected. The main floor was occupied by the livery stable 
proper, with offices at each side of the main entrance. An elevator gave access 
to the upstairs rooms for storage. And the basement was used for stock pens for 
mules, cattle, sheep and hogs. In addition to the large livery barn at the 
corner of the Square, the firm owned and conducted stock yards and loading pens, 
on the railroad, west of the Depot. That was before the days of trucking, and 
practically all the live stock that left the county, north or south, went by 
rail.<br>
In addition to the business conducted here, the firm conducted sites in Atlanta, 
Montgomery, and elsewhere, when the market was active.<br>
Following the Spanish-American War, when Cuba was for a time under the 
government of the United States great numbers of both breeding stock and work 
stock were needed to rebuild the devastated country. With usual alertness, and 
being about the nearest big establishment in position to supply live stock 
direct from the farms, the Pulaski firm seized the opportunity, and sent many 
ship loads of live stock to Pensacola by rail, thence across the Gulf by ship. 
One young man who was working with the firm, Roscoe A. Morris, a brother of Dr. 
J. H. Morris, went to Havana, and opened up a sale barn for the firm. And became 
so much interested in the country that he remained there.<br>
When the Union Bank and Trust Company was organized, Mr. Porter was one of the 
organizers, and became one of the executive officers. And for about thirty 
years, he has been one of the foremost men in the institution. Most of the time 
President and the chief executive. And much of the success of the business, 
which enabled it to withstand the storm which wrecked ten other banks in the 
county, was due to his keen business insight, and his extensive and intimate 
personal acquaintance with the people of Giles County. Other men can carry on 
the work. But no other man can be found to fill his place.<br>
Mr. Porter was a member of the United Methodist Church, and of the official 
board.<br>
Funeral services were conducted at the residence, Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock, 
Rev. G. A. Morgan officiating. The large crowd attending overflowed the 
residence, and the front yard, standing on the street in front of the residence. 
A great wealth of beautiful florals gave evidence of the esteem in which R. H. 
Porter was held by those who knew him, and loved him.<br>
He is survived by his wife and four daughters, Miss Janie Porter and Mesdames 
Rankin Rhea, Wilson Collins and Eddie Rowe.<br>

STONE, T. P. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 10 Mar 1937<br>
T. P. Stone, for fifty years one of the foremost citizens and business men of 
Giles County, died suddenly, in the Court House at Pulaski, Monday morning.<br>
Mr. Stone, remarkably well preserved, and retaining his keen mental activities, 
had within the last week or two been sick with something like a mild attack of 
flu. He remained at home a few days, and on other days would be out about town 
for a little while.<br>
He was up on the Square about 9 o'clock Monday morning, entered the Court House, 
and started up the stair toward the County Court Room. He had passed the first 
landing, and about the third step up, he swayed, and caught the railing. Some 
men on the landing he had just passed, noticed him stagger, caught him, and 
assisted him down. He remarked, &quot;I don't know what has happened.&quot; about the only 
words spoken. He was carried into the County Clerk's office, and physicians 
called. But when they arrived, Mr. Stone was dead.<br>
News of his sudden death, coming as it died so soon after the announcement of 
the death of Dr. Lancaster, Miss Cynthia Carter and Giles Reynolds, was a great 
shock to the entire community.<br>
Mr. Stone was the last member of the old partnership of Stone, Porter, and 
White, one of the foremost business institutions that helped to build a name and 
reputation for Pulaski. In horse and buggy days, the firm of Stone, Porter and 
White, including both livery and live stock business probably handled as many 
transactions in a week, as any three of our automobile establishments of today. 
But the volume of the day's business died not run into money so fast. But the 
firm was known and the name was honored near and far.<br>
Mr. Stone was a member of the United Methodist Church, and for many years served 
on the Board of Stewards. In later years he asked to be relieved of the 
responsibilities of official connection. But kept up regular attendance at 
Sunday School and Church services.<br>
He is survived by a large family of sons and daughters, and his second wife.<br>
After funeral services at the Methodist Church Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock, 
the body was laid away in Maplewood Cemetery.<br>

A Tribute to Martha Lou Topp<br>
The entire community was shrouded in gloom, when the news reached here that the 
pure, sweet spirit of Martha Lou Topp had gently passed away into the Great 
Beyond. Death is always sad, but doubly so, when one in the morning of life with 
bright hopes for the future is snatched from us by the relentless hand of death. 
A host of friends sincerely sympathize with the family and mourn the untimely 
death of this pure, sweet, little girl. While her earthly existence is finished- 
her few short years were not lived in vain, for the influence of her happy 
disposition, kind heart and gentle manners will continue to bless, strengthen 
and comfort all with whom she came in contact. Her cheerful, lovable disposition 
and the influence of her life reached far beyond the confines of her home but 
extended to her schoolmates and in after life, her sweet companionship will 
remain a pleasant memory to them and stimulate them to higher nobler ideals. 
While it is sad to see the family circle broken, they will some day be reunited 
where death are sorrow are unknown. Even at the very brink of death, Martha Lou 
retained her bright smile and deep appreciation for each act of kindness 
administered to her comfort. Just at sunset, she was laid to rest at Lynnwood 
Cemetery beneath a blanket of flowers, a silent tribute of love from devoted and 
sympathetic relatives and friends a fit emblem of her pure life, whose influence 
still lingers with us like a sweet fragrance.<br>
&quot;Yet who would ask to call her, From her home of light above, Who would ask that 
God had left her, Even with our live to guide her, In the paths of good and 
right, Would she still have entered Heaven, With a soul so pure and white,&quot;<br>

Mr. Turner had a quaint style of humor, and assumed the pen name of &quot;Dr. Love&quot; 
as a joke. He was never married, and jokingly referred to his experiences with 
young ladies entitling him to the degree of Doctor in the realm of courtship and 
marriage.<br>
Quite a number of subscribers took the Citizen specially to enjoy his letters. A 
few who did not see the humor in some of his jokes, but took them seriously, 
could never see the point.<br>
Mr. Turner was kind hearted, a devout churchman, quaint, original, had positive 
convictions and was plain spoken. Many friends will breathe a silent prayer, 
that he may rest in peace.<br>

WATKINS, Mildred The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 15 Jul 1936<br>
We regret to report the death of Mildred Watkins who departed this life June 3. 
We feel that she was one of those flowers that the Reaper of Death has taken 
from the Garden of Love. Mildred had such a kind and lovable disposition that 
everybody admired her. She had a winning personality and always greeted you with 
a smile and a kind word. She took a great interest in her church and school work 
winning many prizes and honors. In a county school contest she won first in 
arithmetic, first in spelling and second in the speaking contest, her subject 
being &quot;Sam Davis,&quot; by Mrs. W. B. Romine.<br>

was carrying, was killed, when they were struck by an auto or small truck, 
driven by the husband and father, Mahlon White.<br>
The story, as we get it is that the mother, with the baby, was attending 
services at a church in the neighborhood. Not feeling quite equal to the task of 
carrying the large baby home, the mother sent word by a friend asking the 
husband to come by for them. But apparently he did not come as soon as the 
mother expected, so she started on the way home, carrying the baby. When the 
father came, and found the wife and baby gone, he started after them, and was 
evidently driving fast. Overtaking them, he either did not see them in time, or 
brakes failed to work, or something went wrong. The mother was struck, knocked 
several yards, and rendered unconscious. The baby was so badly hurt that it died 
on the way to the Hospital. After first aid treatment, and a nights rest, Mrs. 
White was able to leave the Hospital and go home, Monday morning.<br>

YANCEY, Robert J. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 13 Jan 1932<br>
The community was horribly shocked Thursday about noon as word passed from one 
to another that Robert Yancey had been shot. A little later as more details 
became known it was learned that he had been riding about all forenoon. He had 
been observed at a number of places, just driving along, but no one attached any 
importance to his movements, supposing he was just out on a business trip.<br>
Between twelve and one o'clock he stopped on the old stage road, east of Tarple 
and fired a shot which took effect in the right temple, passing through the head 
and out through the top of the car. R. T. Graves, living near by came first to 
the car, then went to a neighbor's for assistance. Before he returned J. B. 
Abernathy came up. He found a letter addressed to Mr. Yancey's wife and on the 
envelope a message to whoever might find it, saying he did it himself and asking 
that Yancey Holt be notified.<br>
His father was also notified and the body was rushed to the Hospital where he 
continued to breathe for an hour or two. But nothing could be done for him.<br>
It is supposed that ill health was responsible for the trouble. He had for 
several years been a sufferer with indigestion. Sometimes he would be kept awake 
practically all night with nervous indigestion. And this was aggravated by 
business conditions. And probably during the wakeful hours of the night business 
troubles were magnified.<br>
Mr. Yancey was a modest, quiet, unassuming young man. He did not talk much, 
being naturally of a reticent disposition. But when you came to know him well, 
he was genial and likeable. He was unusually bright and quick in school. Went 
through high school, prep school and college at an early age.<br>
He was a member of the Methodist Church, a member and treasurer of the Official 
Board. He was a member of the Masonic Lodge. But usually spent his evenings with 
his family and did not attend the lodge regularly.<br>
Mr. Yancey married early in life Miss Elizabeth Montgomery, youngest daughter of 
Mrs. Lula H. Montgomery, who with four young daughters moved to Pulaski from her 
former home in Alabama. Besides his wife and little daughter, Jean, he is 
survived by his mother and father, Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Yancey, one sister, Mrs. 
David P. McDuffie, and one borhter, W. J. Jr., known to his friends by the name 
&quot;Billie.&quot;<br>
After funeral services at the home Saturday morning at 10 o'clock, conducted by 
the pastor, Rev. A. J. Morgan, and two former pastors, Dr. T. C. Ragsdale and 
Rev. R. L. Parsons, the body was laid away in Maplewood Cemetery.<br>
A wealth of beautiful florals, and the attendance of an unusually large 
concourse of people, attested the interest and sympathy of many friends.<br>
<br>
YANCEY, W. J. The Pulaski (TN) Citizen 12 Feb 1936<br>
Wednesday evening, February 5, as W. J. Yancey was returning from Memphis where 
he had been to take his son, Billy, in front of Wesley Long's between the 
Bodenham Gin and School House, there was a head on collision between Mr. 
Yancey's car, and one going west.<br>
Marvin Gross of Guntersville, Ala., who was in the west bound car, was killed 
instantly.<br>
Mr. Yokley was rushed to the Hospital in Pulaski, where he died about three 
hours later.<br>
There is a curve in the road at the place where the accident occurred. A little 
hill on which is the Long residence and barn, obstructs to some extent the view 
of approaching cars. So drivers coming from opposite directions as these were, 
cannot see other until rounding the curve.<br>
Probably both cars were going fast, and were too near each other to avoid the 
crash, before the danger was recognized. The left front wheel of each car 
crashed into the other, evidently almost up to the engine.<br>
Louis and Joe Fielding, brothers, living in the Ethridge community, were in the 
car with Mr. Gross. Both were severely hurt. But are reported improving. Otis 
Reynolds, colored, was driving Mr. Yancey's car. Otis was badly shaken up and 
bruised, but is recovering.<br>
W. J. Yancey for forty years has been one of the foremost citizens of Pulaski. 
Farmer, cotton buyer, and banker, he was active in business. He was a consistent 
member of the Methodist Church, a member of the Masonic Lodge, a member of the 
Board of Trustees of Martin College and a citizen who took an active and 
intelligent interest in matters pertaining to Pulaski and Giles County.<br>
Funeral services were held at the Methodist Church Friday afternoon at 2 o'clock 
, Rev. G. A. Morgan, the pastor, was assisted by Rev. J. B. Parsons, Rev. J. J. 
Stowe, and Rev. T. C. Ragsdale, former pastors, and warm personal friends of Mr. 
Yancey.<br>
Mr. Yancey is survived by his wife, who was Miss Beatrice Partrick, one son, 
Billy, and two grandchildren, David McDuffie and Jean Yancey, to whom much 
sympathy is extended.<br>
<br>

daughter, Mrs. Mae Sisk, to the home of Mr. and Mrs. George Smith, and was 
gathering some nuts while Mrs. Smith prepared dinner. When dinner was ready,

not come. When she saw her lying on the ground under the hickory tree, Mrs. 
Smith ran back for her husband. The two of them found Mrs. Yeager dead.<br>
Funeral services were conducted Sunday morning at her late home and burial was
