A 33-year-old volunteer fireman, asleep during a fire at his own home at 
Lewisburg Sunday, was burned to death.<br>
Two bedrooms of the five room home were destroyed about 2:30 a.m. Relatives said 
Lionell (Buddy) Drake, heavy sleeper, was awakened by his wife but apparently 
was not awake enough to follow her out of their flaming bedroom.<br>
Drake was a printer for the Marshall Gazette, a Lewisburg newspaper. His wife, 
Mrs. Dorothy Doss Drake, led her two children out of the house from their 
adjoining bedroom in the front of the house.<br>
Mrs. Drake suffered first and second degree burns on her arms, hips and legs. 
The children were not injured.<br>
Paul McKissack, who is married to Drake's sister, said Mrs. Drake told him she 
thought her husband followed her and the children out of the house. A few 
minutes later she noticed he wasn't with them she said, and tried to re-enter 
the house. She only got as far as the living room. The bedrooms had collapsed in 
flames.<br>
McKissick said, &quot;Lionell was a very heavy sleeper. Dorothy told me she woke him 
up and told him the house was on fire. He said something and she left the room, 
thinking he was following her. He might have gone back to sleep.&quot;<br>
The body was found on the floor about three feet from the bed. Mrs. Drake took 
the children to the home of a neighbor, Willis Fitzpatrick, who called the fire 
department.<br>
Lewisburg firemen said the blaze was confined to the bedrooms and that the blaze 
apparently was caused by faulty wiring in a water heater in a closet just 
outside Mr. and Mrs. Drake's bedroom.<br>
Funeral services were held Monday at 1:30 p. m. at Bennett-May Funeral Home in 
Pulaski, with Paul McKissick, a Church of Christ minister, officiating. Burial

Deputy Sheriff James Newton said Hardiman had suffered a head injury, apparently

might be groans Wednesday night and went outside to investigate. But he returned

her life might have been saved.<br>
Dick Trulson, airport manager said the Huntsville, Ala., resident, could have 
made a safe landing 15 or 20 minutes after she crashed, because the low-lying 
fog had begun to lift.<br>
Mrs. Harmon was returning to Huntsville from Murfreesboro when the accident 
occurred. Trulson said it took authorities two hours to free her from the 
wreckage. He also said that judging by the position of the aircraft, a Cessna 
150, it had nose-dived into the ground. The crash happened in a field less than 
three-tenths of a mile from the runway near U. S. 231.<br>
The body was taken to Columbia for an autopsy.<br>

them. Mrs. Harmon remained behind to fly the other plane back yesterday.<br>

yesterday before he came to work at 7 a. m. He said weather conditions were good 
around Murfreesboro at that time.<br>
Lanier said the woman came in sometime Sunday before bad weather set in, then 
got caught in the weather and had to wait until yesterday to return.<br>
Trulson said the woman had hoped to get to Huntsville in time to get to work. He 
said she radioed the Huntsville tower about weather conditions and was told she 
would be unable to land, and so decided to land at Fayetteville.<br>
She had some of her early flight training at Fayetteville and then gone on to 
Huntsville to complete her work, Trulson said.<br>
Mrs. Harmon was a mathematician in an army computation laboratory at Redstone 
Arsenal at Huntsville.<br>

McKISSICK, Charles Everett The Pulaski Citizen 20 Mar 1963<br>
Funeral services for Charles Everett McKissick, 42, were held Saturday, March 
16, at Williams Funeral Home in Mt. Pleasant.<br>
Mr. McKissick, a brother of Paul McKissick of Pulaski, was killed Friday when 
his car was struck by a freight train at a crossing in the Sandy Hook Community 
near Mt. Pleasant.<br>
According to reports, Mr. McKissick was returning home after taking his children 
to school less than a mile away when the accident occurred.<br>
He apparently failed to see the approaching train. The engineer said the whistle 
and bells were sounding but the train was an &quot;extra&quot; and, ordinarily, would not 
have been traveling along that track in a northbound direction. A regularly 
scheduled southbound train was due along the same track a short time later and 
investigating officers, State Trooper Jere Starnes and Marion Sellers, indicate 
that Mr. McKissick probably heard the sound of the approaching train and looked 
only toward the north, expecting only the regular-run train.<br>
According to reports, the car was dragged about 132 feet along the track before 
being thrown clear of the train.<br>
Mr. McKissick was the son of Mrs. Bertha Prentice McKissick of Mt. Pleasant and 
the late Frank McKissick. His wife, Imogene Cooper McKissick, survives.<br>
Other survivors include a daughter, Miss Joy McKissick, and a son, Monty 
McKissick, both of Sandy Hook; four sisters, Mrs. Janie Vernon, Columbia; Mrs. 
George Lentz and Mrs. Leslie Stewart, both of Mt. Pleasant; and Mrs. Wilson

TILLERY, Elzie Alvis The Pulaski Citizen 13 Nov 1968<br>
The first fatality occurring on the Interstate Highway in Giles County, was 
reported Monday night by State Trooper James W. Dyer, when an Ardmore man was 
killed in a one-car accident at Sinking Creek Bridge. It also marks the twelfth 
auto fatal accident in the county this year. The victim was Elzie Alvis Tillery, 
Jr., 42 years old mechanic employed at Elkton Farm and Home Store.<br>
According to Trooper Dyer who was patrolling the highway with Trooper Robert 
Worsham and Lt. James W. Chandler, they reached the scene only moments after the 
accident, about 11:11 p. m.<br>
The automobile had hit the bridge abutment and Tillery had been thrown out, and 
was lying about forty feet from the vehicle, which was almost totally 
demolished.<br>
He was taken to Giles County Hospital where he died at 12:45 a. m.<br>
<br>
According to the reports, Tillery was en route to his home at Ardmore when the 
accident happened. The body was taken to Rainey Funeral Home where funeral 
services were held Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock, the Rev. Pat Abernathy of 
Athens, Ala. Pentisostal Church officiating. Burial was scheduled to take place

TILLERY, John Elbert The Pulaski Citizen 13 Dec 1967<br>
A grand jury due to meet in January will investigate the death early Saturday, 
Dec. 9, of an Ardmore man who was fatally shot Friday night by a town policeman 
after he had fired twice at the officer.<br>
The following account of events preceding the shooting was reported by Bob Henry 
Walker, Nashville Banner correspondent.<br>
Elifus Sanders, policeman on the Alabama side of this stateline town, said &quot;it 
was either him or me&quot; after John Elbert Tillery, 43, fired both barrels of a 
shotgun at him and Sanders retaliated with one blast from a 12-guage riot gun.<br>
Tillery, shot on Depot Street, near Ardmore High School, where a basketball game 
was in progress, died at Athens-Limestone Hospital at 12:45 a. m Saturday.<br>
Limestone County Sheriff M. W. Evans gave this report of the shoot-out after an 
investigation.<br>
Sanders and off-duty Tennessee policeman Terry Bottom were at the basketball 
game when an Ardmore resident reported to them a car had struck his auto and 
sped off, but not before he obtained the car's tag number.<br>
Sanders said he would investigate as soon as the basketball game was over. A few 
minutes later two youths came to the Alabama officer and said an old-model car 
had backed into Sanders police car, apparently deliberately. They gave him the 
tag number, which corresponded with the one given in the earlier hit-and-run 
incident.<br>
As Sanders was examining the damage to his car, another meeting the description 
given him earlier passed at a high rate of speed. Sanders pursued the vehicle, 
which turned on to Depot Street, paralleling the L &amp; N tracks.<br>
He went approximately a block and a half, Sanders told Evans. &quot;When I got within 
about 60 feet of him, he stopped his car, got out with a shotgun and pointed it 
at my car.&quot;<br>
The officer said as he turned his car sharply to the right, two blasts from the 
shotgun held by the man identified as Tillery shattered the ventilator window on 
the right front door and pelted the windshield and door. Sanders ducked down on 
the front seat, grabbed the riot gun and backed out of the patrol car.<br>
I told him to drop the gun, said Sanders, &quot;but he didn't drop it and didn't say 
anything. I saw it was either him or me so I shot him one time with a .12-guage 
riot gun.&quot;<br>
The charge of .00 buck shot struck Tillery in the left side and left leg and he 
fell to the roadway near his car, which had rolled off a driveway culvert.<br>
<br>
Sheriff Evans said Sanders had arrested Tillery's teenage son, Johnny Wayne, 
before the basketball game, charging him with wreckless driving and possessing a 
pistol. He took the youth to the town jail but released him after allowing young 
Tillery to sign his own bond.<br>
Limestone County Court records show Tillery sued Sanders in September 1965 for 
$10,000, claiming the officer unlawfully and wrongfully assaulted him when 
Sanders arrested him in April 1964. The jury found in favor of Sanders.<br>
Funeral services for Tillery, a Redstone Arsenal employee, were at 2 p. m. 
Sunday at Cash Point, Tenn., Baptist Church. Burial was in Gatlin Cemetery.<br>
Surviving are his wife; a son, John Wayne; a daughter, Jennifer; his mother,

Tillery, Huntsville.<br>
