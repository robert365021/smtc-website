JOHNSON, Walter J. OBITUARY: The Pulaski Citizen, 12 Apr 1988<br>
Dr. Walter J. Johnson, a widely-known physician and community activist, died 
Sunday morning at Pulaski's Hillside Hospital. He was 97 years old.<br>
Services were this morning (Tuesday) at First United Methodist Church of 
Pulaski, of which he was long a member, with Dr. David Miller and the Rev. J. 
Dallas Bass officiating. Burial was in Maplewood Cemetery with Carr and Erwin 
Funeral Home in charge of arrangements.<br>
The death of Dr. Johnson ended a long career in medicine that was said to have 
begun wth his care of animals at his family home near Ardmore, Ala. It was said 
to have been an injured pig that the 12-year-old boy nurtured to health that 
first revealed his penchant for medicine.<br>
And his passing also claimed a community booster who was credited with having 
been something of a pioneer in obtaining badly needed industry for Giles County, 
a businessman who began as a boy selling eggs and roses to become board chairman 
of a major local bank.<br>
Dr. Johnson was born in Cairo, Ala., a community just south of Ardmore, in 1890, 
Upon completion of his local schooling, he entered the University of Tennessee 
College of Medicine where he graduated in 1914. He was the last surviving member 
of his college medical class.<br>
Returning to this area, he began his medical practice in McBurg and 
Cornersville, Tenn., then opened his own private hospital on Jefferson Street in 
Pulaski in 1929-operating that complex until 1950.<br>
He practiced with the late Dr. J. U. Speer until 1988 and his retirement at age 
83. His career spanned treatment of generations of Giles Countians.<br>
Dr. Johnson was among those who traveled to Nashville to convince General Shoe 
Company to open a manufacturing plant in Pulaski. They were successful and the 
plant opened here in 1938 and continued in operation until 1986-employing 
approximately 600 people for much of that period.<br>
And it was Dr. Johnson who joined others in formation of Richland Bank here. The 
bank opened in 1938 and later became known as the First National Bank of today.<br>
<br>
He served as the bank's first president, a position he held upon 1952 when he 
was named board chairman. He in turn served in that capacity until 1963, then 
became chairman emeritus which he continued to be until his death Sunday.<br>
Following his graduation from medical college, he served his country in France 
during World War I, continuing his support for veterans through membership in 
the American Legion in which he was a lifetime member.<br>
Although he was one of Giles County's most beloved and active citizens, it was 
through his skills as a doctor that led him to become best known. Announcement 
of his retirement plans was said have cast a &quot;pall&quot; among the many who had been 
treated by him.<br>
Throughout much of his medical career, his wife, Covie Johnson, worked at his 
side as a nurse. She survives.<br>
Extremely active for many years in his profession, he was a member of the 
Tennessee Medical Licensing Board for 15 years. His many other professional 
memberships included the American Medical Association, the Southeastern Surgical 
College, the Tennessee Medical Association and the International College of 
Surgeons. He also was a member of the Giles County Medical Society.<br>
Dr. Johnson was a 32nd degree Mason, a Shriner and a member of the First United 
Methodist Church.<br>
Survivors in addition to his wife include two daughters, Geraldine Bell of 
Nashville and Sybil Blumenberg of St. Louis, Mo.; four grandchildren, Melinda 
Cherry of Franklin, Mike Bell of Tallahassee, Fla., Lisa and Christy Blumenberg 
of St. Louis; three great-grandchildren.<br>
Contributions in his honor many be made to the Dr. W. J. Johnson Scholarship

RHEA, Dan OBITUARY: The Pulaski Citizen, 3 Sep 1980<br>
The remains of Giles County native Dan Rhea were discovered Friday afternoon in 
a shallow grave near Columbia in Maury County. Rhea, a Memphis attorney, was 
last seen 19 months ago, January 27, 1979 as he left his mother's home near 
Campbellsville at 5:30 p. m. to run an errand, expecting to be back in an hour.<br>
Authorities believe Rhea, who had been shot in the head, was the victim of 
robbery as he had in his possession $26,000 and only pocket change, a couple of 
dollar bills, comb, watch, cigarette lighter and cigarettes were found on his 
body.<br>
<br>
Acting on a tip received by Marshall County officials from an informant, Maury 
County Sheriff Bill Voss, TBI Agents Andrew Earl and Jerry Eubank, Marshall 
County Sheriff Danny McDaniels, and Dr. William Bass, the head of the University 
of Tennessee's Anthropology Department, with two assistants Steve Symes and Pat 
Wiley, all went to a bean field off Iron Bridge Road in Mauy County, 
approximately 100 yards outside Columbia's city limits in search of the body. 
Using a front end loader to dig, the men chose a spot at random and started 
digging after glasses, believed to be Rhea's were found near a clump of trees. 
After three scrapes, the loader operator, Jimmy Campbell, unearthed a section of 
hand. For the next three hours small hand tools and brushes were used to uncover 
the remains, which had been buried approximately 12 inches of dirt. The remains 
were taken to Memphis on Saturday where Dr. Jim Bell, assistant medical examiner 
will perform an autopsy.<br>
All evidence collected at the gravesite will be turned over to District Attorney 
General Bob Gay for further investigation. No arrests have been made at this 
time.<br>
Rhea's car was found February 3 in the Maury County Hospital parking lot where 
officers believe it had been left on the night he was murdered. Money wrappers 
were also found in the car. Rhea had come to Giles County to visit his mother 
and to go to a family reunion in Nashville the following day, January 28.<br>
Daniel F. B. Rhea, 35, was the son of the late Giles County General Sessions 
Judge David Rhea, Jr. and Mrs. Louise Rhea of the Campbellsville community. He 
was a Giles County High School graduate and received his undergraduate and law 
degree from U. T. in Knoxville. For a brief period he was associated with the 
Pulaski law firm of Wade and Forrester and then moved to Nashville working for 
the University of Tennessee office of General Counsel.<br>
While the body found has not been officially identified as that of Rhea, 
officials are &quot;99 and 44 one-hundreths percent sure it's him.&quot; Clothing on the 
body matches those Rhea was wearing when last seen, a cross given to Rhea by a 
friend was identified, and x-rays of pins in Rhea's leg were identical to x-rays 
made of the body, Friday afternoon.<br>
TBI Agent Andrew Earl stated &quot;There is a long way to go and the investigation is 
not over.<br>

TREADWELL, James OBITUARY: The Pulaski Citizen, 4 Mar 1981<br>
A twenty-seven year old Pulaski resident, James Treadwell, was killed instantly 
during a mishap in McBurg last Thursday morning (February 25) at approximately 
7:30 a. m., when a heavy piece of equipment he was hauling shifted and rolled 
forward onto the cab.<br>
According to the investigating officer, State Trooper Sgt. Jim Rose the truck 
was headed east on Pulaski Highway when it topped a hill and started down the 
steep grade.<br>
At the same time a Lincoln County School bus, driven by David Colby was stopped 
in front of a residence at the foot of the hill to pick up children. That is 
when the driver applied his brakes causing the equipment, a large bulldozer 
track, rolled onto the cab, killing the driver.<br>
The truck then went out of control across the westbound land and through a guard 
rail. The equipment landed in the yard of Thomas Thorpe very close to where 
children were standing before running for cover.<br>
According to the trooper, the speed and weight of the vehicle were contributing 
factors in the mishap.<br>

the rig pass. He noted that the tracks were not tied down and wondered what 
would happen if the rig had to come to a sudden stop.<br>
