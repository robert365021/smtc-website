<p><font face="Arial">ABERNATHY, Annie Birdsong The Pulaski Citizen 08 Jun 1905<br>
Mrs. Annie Abernathy, wife of M. T. Abernathy, and eldest daughter of Rev. John 
H. Birdsong, deceased, after a lingering illness of many months, departed this 
life May 24th, 1905, aged 54 years.<br>
A good woman has left us. A kind and affectionate wife, a loving and tender 
mother will be missed in the home made happy by her affable, gentle nature.<br>
To the bereaved husband and children, I deeply sympathize with you in the loss 
of the dearest friend on earth to you, but rejoice in her gain. Few such noble 
women bless the many homes of our land. You have many reasons to be grateful.<br>
Annie is not dead, but sleepeth, and on the Resurrection Morn, will rise in that 
splendor and beauty to an eternal home with God.<br>
Children! Emulate her noble character, and you will live with her again. Mother 
can't come back to you, but you can go to her.<br>
Annie died in the full assurance that her home would be with Jesus, whom, in 
early life she learned to love and serve. God has called a prize home. So you 
have attraction to draw you Heavenward. Therefore mourn for her, not as lost, 
but saved with an eternal Salvation.<br>
&quot;Beyond this vale of tears - There is a life above, Unmeasured by the flight of 
years, And all that life is love.&quot; P. J. A.<br>

ABERNATHY, Edwin F. The Pulaski Citizen 23 Jan 1902<br>
A most unfortunate and deplorable accident occurred at Prospect Friday morning 
resulting in the instant death of Ed Abernathy, one of our best citizens.<br>
Mr. Abernathy spoke of going a hunting and took up his gun directly after 
breakfast and walked into the back yard at his home, to clean the gun. It is 
supposed that when he unbreached the gun to throw out the shells, the ejector 
failed to work, and without noticing, the gun was locked again with one shell in 
it. The he took the ram rod and started to wipe out the gun barrels when in some 
way the shell remaining in the gun was exploded, the charge entering the breast 
just above the heart causing instant death.<br>
Mrs. Abernathy and the cook were in the house at the time, and a little negro 
girl was standing on the back porch looking at him when the accident occurred.<br>

impressive service by Rev. Mr. Chenault, in the presence of a large number of

ABERNATHY, Robin The Pulaski Citizen 15 Sep 1910<br>
Robin Abernathy, son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert D. Abernathy, died about 6 o'clock 
yesterday morning, at the home of his parents on East Hill. Age 27 years.<br>
And in this simple sentence is interwoven a story of pain and patience, faith 
and hope, fidelity and devotion, tenderness and loving care, such as is not met 
with every day in this mortal life of shifting scenes and vanishing forms and 
faces.<br>
Robin Abernathy was an exceptional young man, and life was bright before, when, 
a number of years ago, he was stricken with typhoid fever, and after a long 
illness recovered only to soon find that he was hopeless cripple from its 
effects. Rheumatism later developed and for many years, Mr. Abernathy was a 
constant suffer from this source of human woe. His disease baffled the best of 
treatments.<br>
But for all that, he continued bright and cheerful, and in the capacity of 
Deputy Clerk and Master he was careful, prompt, punctual and accurate, and made 
one of the most competent obliging and popular of the court house force of 
officials.<br>
When more than a year ago, he was forced to give up work and become bedridden, 
he was greatly missed about the courthouse, and especially in the Chancery Court 
Clerk's office, and his many friends earnestly hoped for his restoration to 
health, a vain hope to which the passing months held out no encouragement, and 
he lapsed into a state of submissive suffering, becoming the object of the most 
tender care and solicitude of the faithful young wife and devoted parents nor 
did the Sam Davis Council forget him. So painful was his tortured body that the 
slightest touch was sufficient to cause groans of agony and only twice within 
the past year was he turned from one position to another.<br>
The burial will be at Maplewood Cemetery this afternoon after funeral services 
at the Methodist Church at 3 o'clock by Rev. G. A.Morgan.<br>
Sam Davis Council No. 21, Junior Order United American Mechanics will march from

Craig, Harry L. Aymett, Steele Thompson, Braden Fleming and Joe Childers.<br>
&quot;Beyond the flight of time, Beyond the reign of death, There surely is some 
blessed clime, Where life is not a breath.&quot; &quot;Farewell Brother&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
ABERNATHY, Rosana The Pulaski Citizen 09 May 1901 &quot;In Memoriam&quot;<br>
The friends and relatives of our community were shocked to hear of the death of 
Mrs. Rosanna Abernathy, which occurred April 7, at the home of her daughter, 
Mrs. Ben Williams, Red Oak, Texas. Mrs. Abernathy was born June 3, 1824. She 
joined Bethesda church several years ago, and as long as she lived she held 
tenderly to her faith and trusted in the Blessed Savior. She was kind and ready 
to do what the Master said. But her life's journey is over she has gone to the 
home where sorrows never come. But by our desolate hearth stands an empty chair. 
In the home once joyous now lonely and bare.<br>
But the Father's house has opened its door, to shelter one happy forever more 
&quot;When we told her goodby four years ago, when she left us to make her home in 
Texas, we did not think she was leaving us forever or that we would never see 
her again. But time has scattered the snowy flakes on her brow, has plowed deep 
furrows on her cheeks, her lips were thin and sunken, but those were the lips 
that had kissed many a hot tear from the childish cheek and they were the 
sweetest lips in the world. Her eyes were dim, yet glowed with the soft radiance 
of Holy love that would never fade. The sands of life were nearly run out, but 
feeble as she was she could go further and reach lower down for you than any one 
on earth. But let us not greave for her for we know she has gone to join the 
loving parents, dear husband and four children, who have already passed beyond 
death's river. She leaves five children, three in Texas, two here, thirty 
grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren to mourn her loss. Besides the many 
friends and relatives who deeply realize that our community, her old home, has 
lost a good mother of Israel. Olivia Brown &amp; Daisy Abernathy.<br>
<br>

<br>
ABERNATHY, Samuella D. Tannehill The Pulaski Citizen 24 Apr 1902<br>
Mrs. Burwell Abernathy , formerly Miss Samuella D. Tannehill, of Aspen Hill, 
died Tuesday at her home in Chattanooga at 8 p.m.<br>
Mrs. Abernathy leaves three children, namely Mrs. Robert D. Abernathy, of

<br>
ABERNATHY, Susan Rebecca Denty The Pulaski Citizen 04 Apr 1901<br>
Mrs. Susan Rebecca Abernathy, wife of Capt. James E. Abernathy, of Ocellus, 
Giles County, and daughter of T. J. and Elizabeth Denty, was born Dec. 9, 1833. 
She was married to Capt. Abernathy on Oct. 5, 1852, and departed this life March 
22, 1901, after a brief illness. She was converted at an early age and joined 
the Methodist church, in which she was a consistent and zealous member during 
the whole of her subsequent life. She devoted her life to the rearing and 
education of her children, consisting of two sons and six daughters. In this, 
being ably assisted by her husband, she was eminently successful. Their 
daughters are without exception highly educated and practical business women. 
Their sons are intelligent, energetic and manly. She had the satisfaction 
realizing the benefit of her judicious training, in that her children were 
always ready to minister to every want of their parents, and willingly relieved 
the mother of the burdens of domestic life. What more could she have done than 
to &quot;train up her children in the way they should go?&quot; This she did well-it was 
her life work-that done, she &quot;rests from her labors.&quot; She was a dutiful 
daughter, a faithful wife, a devoted mother, a kind neighbor, and thoughtful of 
the poor and needy. The writer knew her well when she was a school girl &quot;in her 
teens.&quot; Fair as a lily, eyes blue and laughing, a golden blonde, cheeks roseate 
with the bloom of health and teeth of pearly whiteness, she was most beautiful. 
These physical characteristics, coupled with a lovely disposition, secured for 
her the admiration of all who knew her. As age advanced and the color of her 
cheeks faded, her features grew in intelliget and benevolent expression, 
indicating a noble womanhood, exemplified in her daily life. Her death is a 
calamity not only to her family, but to the neighborhood in which she was 
universally respected and beloved. She has gone from among us, but her life was 
such that in the language of the lamented McFerrin, we &quot;will know where to find 
her.&quot; A Friend.<br>
<br>

ANTHONY, Helen The Pulaski Citizen 18 Jan 1900<br>
Miss Helen Anthony died on Tuesday after an illness of about a week of 
pneumonia, and shock caused by the death of her brother, who died Thursday of 
last week.<br>
Miss Helen was a very lovable, accomplished young lady, attractive for her 
personal charms, maidenly modesty and gentleness, and it is oh so hard to think 
of one such as she lying like a crushed lily in death's cold and loveless 
embrace.<br>
Rev. Granville Allison spoke the sad and solemn funeral service at the Memorial 
Church of the Messiah yesterday morning at 10 o'clock and then sorrowing hands

which the interment took place at Maplewood in the presence of sorrowing and 
sympathizing friends.<br>
Marc Anthony was one of our best young men, and chief among the qualities which

energy, honesty, purity, amithy devotion and faithfulness to the duties which 
devolved upon him in business life.<br>
He enjoyed to the fullest extent the confidence and respect of his employer, his 
associates in business and a long list of friends. He was idolized at home where 
affection and gentleness habitually marked his conduct. It was the subject of 
comment that the burial services were beautiful and touching.<br>

sympathy with the assurance that the earthly sunset of life like Marc's is but 
the dawn of a brilliant life eternal.<br>

AYMETT, Annie Eliza Harwell The Pulaski Citizen 21 Jan 1904<br>
Mrs. John M. Aymett died in Nashville, Thursday, Jan. 14, just as the evening 
sun was sinking behind the western hills, the spirit of Mrs. John M. Aymett took 
its flight from Douglass' Infirmary, Nashville, where she had gone for 
treatment. And loved ones who watched beside her experienced that peculaiarly 
painful sense of loneliness and desolate separation from mother and companion 
which is known only to those who have been called upon to pass through a 
similiar ordeal.<br>
Mrs. John M. Aymett was the daughter of Rev. Logan Harwell, a Methodist 
preacher, and having been raised to love the church, she became a member in 
early girlhood and lived a consistent Christian life.<br>
In the dawn of young womanhood she was married to John M. Aymett with whom she 
lived happily till her untimely death. Two children were born to them, a son who 
died when a small boy, and a daughter, Mrs. J. A. Loyd.<br>
Mrs. Aymett had been in feeble health for two or three years, but as she was not 
given to complaining, many intimate friends died not know how serious was her 
condition.<br>
As a last resort she submitted patiently to an operation which the doctors said 
offered the only hope and that was slight. She came out from the influence of 
ether and lived two days, retaining consciousness to the last.<br>
The body was brought back here and taken to the home of J. A. Loyd where it was 
virwed by a large concourse of friends and neighbors by whom Mrs. Aymett was so 
greatly loved. She was of a quiet retiring disposition devoting her life and 
energies largely to the welfare and happiness of others. And perhaps no one in 
the county was more generally loved.<br>
The funeral was conducted at the Methodist Church by Rev. J. W. Cherry and Rev. 
H. B. Reams, then the body was laid to rest in Maplewood.<br>
<br>

declining health for several months and her death was not unexpected. She was a

the garments of pure womanhood and christian living. Mrs. Aymett said it was her 
great desire to live and e with her family yet if it was the father's will she 
was ready to go. Her suffering was intense but she bore it patiently. She left 
upon this side of eternity to mourn her loss a loving husband, one daughter and 
three sons who have our heart felt sympathy in their sad bereavement. After

BARNES, Joel Lucas The Pulaski Citizen 13 May 1909 In Memory of J. L. Barnes<br>
It is with profound sorrow we would pay tribute to the memory of J. L. Barnes 
and thank God for his noble Christian life. He was born Sept. 1st, 1830, and 
died April 5th, 1909. The silver cord is loosed, the golden bowl is broken. He 
lies now as low as Caesar. No lower than kings or princes and no higher than 
peasants and paupers. He has paid great nature's debt and is no more on earth. 
He has gone to that undiscovered country to which all of us are hastening. J. L. 
Barnes was born and reared in Giles County. He was a farmer and rock mason by 
profession. He was living with his third wife at the time of his death. Was a 
member of the Methodist church, a steward in this church for 30 years and a 
Confederate soldier of the 3rd Tennessee Infantry, and also a member of Bradshaw 
Lodge No. 256 F. and A. M., loyal and true in every relation of life. He was of 
a social disposition and loved his friends with a devotion seldom seen, a 
remarkably cheerful and warm hearted man. He was a comprising man, a peace maker 
as he complied with the Christian injunction found in Matthew 5th chapter and 
9th verse, which says, &quot;Blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called 
the children of God.&quot; He reproved and rebuked sin at any and all times, a good 
neighbor and trusted friend, the noblest Roman of them all. He met the 
responsibilities and demands upon him as a strong man always does with fortitude 
and uprightness and was always ready and prepared to bear his part of the 
burdens necessary for the advancement of the church, his country and society. 
And Uncle Luke is dead. Oh, sad to relate. Alas my brother. Those tired hands 
and frail body can now take a rest as long as eternity. With loving hand and 
many tears we buried him in the Maplewood Cemetery in Pulaski.<br>
<br>

raised a large family of children, seven boys and four girls, six of whom are

it.<br>
Uncle Jim and Aunt Sallie (as his wife was called) lived a long, prosperous and 
happy life together, she having preceded him to their home above about eighteen 
months.<br>
Uncle Jim was a man of fine mind and business sense. He was of a political hint 
of mind and studied and kept posted upon the politics of the country. He was a 
man of firm will and strong convictions and his position upon any and all 
subjects could be found easily. He was a good, substatial citizen, a kind, 
obliging neighbor and the latch string of his door always hung on the outside to 
his friends and to the stranger, and he never forgot the poor, the widow and the 
orphan. He was a member of the Primitive Baptist Church at Lynnville, Tenn., and 
he was strong in the faith.<br>
Uncle Jim's health began to decline soon after his wife's death, and he suffered 
a great deal from dropsy three months preceding his death. His children, 
grandchildren, and friends nursed him as faithfully and tenderly as any one 
could desire.<br>
He was interred in the family burying ground at the old home near Bradshaw, 
Tenn., Dec. 31, 1899, being attended by a host of friends and relatives.<br>
The country has lost a good citizen and useful man, the family a kind father and

has to her credit.<br>

ready, all is well.&quot; His death was typical of his life, so quiet, so resigned, 
so peaceful. Near the family residence the body was interred, Friday afternoon. 
The services were conducted by Rev. W. J. Stewart, Lynnville, assisted by Rev.

Mrs. Elizabeth Jane Beaty, relict of the late Dr. Joseph Beaty, passed 
peacefully from death to life Saturday evening, August 2nd, at the home of her 
son in law, Dr. J. E. Baugh, Elkton, Tennessee. The usual time limit of three 
score and ten was lengthened in her case to eighty four years. It was not the 
writers privilege to know her till middle life, when she was an acknowledged 
force for good in her community.<br>
Blessed with a strong body, unusual mentality and joy giving personality she was 
a welcome guest in every home. She was fearless in her condemnation of evil 
wherever she found it, but so absolutely just that no one took offense. She 
argued that truth was the only weapon needed for victory. Going about doing good 
she was a familiar figure on the streets and lanes of her beloved home town.<br>
Whenever there was sickness, want or sorrow, &quot;Miss Jennie,&quot; as she was 
familiarly called was sure to follow in the steps of doctor and minister; doing 
in her practical, intelligent way, the needful thing. She suffered long from a 
broken limb but as soon as she could hobble about on crutches, found her way 
from house to house bringing back the sunshine of her cheerful presence to 
nearby friends.<br>
During her last sickness, which rendered her an invalid many months, she was 
patient and resigned to the will of God but she is gone, this strong, good, true 
woman. We shall not see her likes again. Those who enjoyed an intimate 
friendship with her, have suffered a great loss, those who knew her slightly 
have missed much. Just now and then God gives the world such a beacon light.<br>

A letter from Albert Birdsong last Thursday from Texas stated that his father, 
Meritt Birdsong was dead, which was sad news here where he had a host of friends 
and relatives. He died on the 3rd of May at Boswell, L.T.<br>
Meritt as everybody knew was a good fellow and brave as a lion. He left here 
about eight years ago for Texas going through by land with his family in a 2 two 
horse wagons, in company with J. E. Abernathy. One of his horses died while 
going through Arkansas and he sold his wagon and make a spike team, to the other 
wagon with the other horse.<br>

BIRDSONG, John The Pulaski Citizen 11 Oct 1900<br>
The report that John Birdsong had been killed has been verified. The unfortunate 
young man was killed at Lexington, OK., about 9 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 30.<br>
He had taken hold of a live guy wire on the electric company's line, corner of 
Broadway and West First street. He screamed and fell. Several ran to his 
assistance, but found him dying. One of those who came to him took hold of the 
same wire and narrowly escaped death, being knocked senseless.<br>
The coroner's jury found that: John Birdsong came to his death by coming in 
contact with a live wire belonging to the Purcell Electric Company.<br>
He was 28 years old, unmarried, and was a clerk at the family grocery store of 
T. M. Gordon at the time if his death.<br>
At the time of the accident Birdsong was acting as night watchman for Mr. Glenn, 
who was attending the evening church service, and would have been relieved in a 
few minutes.<br>
The fatal wire was on one time used for an arc light which had been 
discontinued, and the wire was left anticipating an order from the city to 
resume the light. Some weeks ago the wire was loosened from the pole on the 
north side of the street by some linemen and coiled around the cross bar on the 
pole on the south side, but leaving the wire fastened to the pole near the top 
by an iron ring.<br>
About 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon the wire fell from the cross bar to the street 
and was picked up by someone and hung on the south side of the pole, with the 
part still fastened at the top resting against the wire which carried the full 
voltage from the power house. This loose wire, which was also touching the guy 
wire, which was fastened to a post set in the ground by the sidewalk and not 
supposed to be in any way connected with the current.<br>
The power house carried 1, 000 volts.<br>
John Birdsong was liked by all who knew him at Lexington and had many friends 
there.<br>

Mr. Birdsong was formerly a resident of this county, but removed to Ohio about 
40 years ago.<br>
He is survived by his second wife and his son, Will H. Birdsong, the well known 
mechanic of Pulaski, a daughter who also survives, resides in Ohio.<br>
Alexandria, Ohio Newspaper Friday, 04 May 1908<br>
William Birdsong was born near Bunker Hill in Giles County, Tenn., Oct. 2, 1840, 
died at his home in Alexandria, May 1, 1908, aged 67 years, 6 months and 1 day. 
He lived in Tennessee during the earlier days and when the Civil War broke out 
enlisted in the Confederate Army and served one year, when he deserted and 
joined the Union Army and served until the close of the war. After the war he 
came to Marysville, Union County, OH., from thence he removed to Alexandria, 
Licking Co.<br>
In 1865 he married Abigal White, two children were born to this union. William 
and Belle. After the death of his first wife in 1878 he married Mrs. Nancy 
Skinner in 1884. Mr. Birdsong was member of the Baptist Church for 18 years. He 
was a man of upright life, a good citizen and a faithful Christian.<br>
Owing to the difficulty in reaching his son, Wm., in Tennessee by telegram he 
was not able to reach here in time to attend the funeral. His death has taken 
one more from the ranks of the boys in blue and those that are left are getting 
more stooped, their hair turning snowy white. Their race will soon be run and 
they will be laid beside their comrades in the city of the dead, but the 
principle they fought for and services they rendered their country will live on 
through the ages.<br>

BLEDSOE, Margaret Wilson The Pulaski Citizen 25 Jul 1901<br>

remained to the sorrowing ones.<br>
For two years, one month and eleven days this winsome little maiden has 
scattered sunshine ine the home her presence blessed. To those who had come 
under the spell of her bright attractions, it is not strange that she was a

Funeral services were conducted by Rev. W. J. Stewart, and the remains interred 
Sunday morning in Lynnville Cemetery.<br>
The bereaved family has the sympathy of the entire community.<br>

BOATRIGHT, Kittie The Pulaski Citizen 17 Nov 1904 Lynnville News<br>
Friends and relatives were greatly shocked and saddened Saturday morning by the 
announcement of the sudden death of Miss Kittie Boatright which occurred at 
11:30 o'clock Friday night at the residence of her sister, Mrs. R. M. Bugg with 
whom she resided. She had spent the evening with a neighbor and retired 
seemingly in her usual health. A short time afterwards she was suddenly seized 
with hemorrhage of the lungs and expired before medical assistance could reach 
her. Having been on the streets late Friday afternoon it was hard to convince 
people of her death. Miss Kittie was a popular and greatly beloved woman with 
many noble traits of christian character and her death is indeed a severe blow 
to her family and friends. She leaves besides her sister Mrs. Bugg, and brother 
Ike Boatright, two nieces, Miss Reesie Boatright and Mrs. George Eubank, and a 
nephew Raymond Boatright, whom she helped to raise and educate, in addition to a 
large family connection. Her place will be hard to fill, and the heartfelt 
sympathy of all is extended the bereaved family. Funeral services were conducted 
by Elder S. R. Logue at the home of R. M. Bugg Sunday afternoon in the presence 
of an immense gathering of relatives and friends followed by interment in 
Lynnwood cemetery. Many beautiful floral designs attested the high esteem in 
which she was held.<br>
<br>

general expressions of regret and surprise, as he had been sick only a short

superinduced, so we are informed, by small pox.<br>
He was one of the one of the best and most popular business young man in town; 
quiet, gentlemanly, and correct in his habits, a member of the Methodist church, 
and the Knights of Pythias lodge.<br>

the sympathy of the community.<br>

BRANNON, Noah Alexander The Pulaski Citizen 21 Feb 1907<br>
N. A. Brannon died at his home in Pulask, on Thursday and was buried at 
Maplewood, after funeral services conducted at the residence by Elder S. R. 
Logue, of Lynnville.<br>
Mr. Brannon was born in East Tennessee in 1842 and was an ex-Confederate soldier 
during the Civil War, entering the service when about 18 years of age. He was 
captured and imprisoned until paroled. His health was impaired by his army 
experience and confinement, and after the close of hostilities, finding it 
unpleasant to live in East Tennessee, traveled for several years engaging in 
different kinds of business, finally locating at South Pittsburg, and later at 
Murfreesboro, coming from there to Pulaski, and buying an interest in the saw 
mill and lumber business of W. B. Earthman and Company, which later became the 
well known firm of Brannon and Hopper.<br>
Mr. Brannon had for a long time been a consistent member of the Christian 
church. His health has been failing for several years during which time he 
sustained two or three strokes of paralysis.<br>
Mr. Brannon was a good citizen and has many friends who will regret his death.<br>
He is survived by his second wife and three children, Lee and Merton, of 
Nashville, and Miss Julia, of Pulaski, who have much sympathy in their 
bereavement.<br>
<br>
The Pulaski Citizen 28 Feb 1907 &quot;Failed to Make History&quot;<br>
The late N. A. Brannon's experience in the civil war would make interesting 
reading if it had been written.<br>
Mr. Brannon was captured and imprisoned with a large number of Confederates at 
Camp Chase, near Columbus, Ohio.<br>
A dress parade occassion came off one day and the Federal officers and soldiers 
in their glittering uniforms did not anticipate any trouble with their 
prisoners.<br>
But Mr. Brannon and another ring-leader had planned to escape. There were more 
than one thousand ex-Confederates. At a preconcerted signal they would rush out, 
overpower the guards, secure the arms of the soldiers rush into Columbus, burn 
the town, supply themselves with necessaries, and march for the South.<br>
Mr. Brannon and his friend, executed their part and escaped temporarily, but the 
rest of the prisoners balked at the last moment, the opportunity was lost, and 
the scheme fell through.<br>
The Federals were amazed at the brilliant audacity of the escapade, and were 
almost a minute or two collecting their wits.<br>
Mr. Brannon and his companion were recaptured and put in chains. But before this 
they were offered substantial evidences of Yankee disapproval.<br>
Mr. Brannon's friend had knocked a guard down. This man thought Mr. Brannon had 
done it and shot at him with a pistol. Some one knocked the weapon up and the 
bullet passed through Mr. Brannon's hat. Weary, disgusted and disappointed he 
defied the Yankee to shoot him. But he was not allowed to do so.<br>
<br>
Then they took the two daring Confederates and pushed them head first into tight 
plank boxes where they kept them until they were almost dead.<br>
This barbarous act was repeated until the army surgeon present told the Federals 
that the men would die if treated that way one more time, and he would indict 
them for murder.<br>
Then they desisted.<br>
Sometimes afterward Mr. Brannon was paroled. Thus a brilliant page missed 
getting into the history of the Civil War.<br>

BRASHEARS, James The Pulaski Citizen 21 Oct 1915<br>

four o'clock Monday afternoon at the home of his parents in Pulaski, after 
suffering for about two weeks with cerebral ailment, aged 1 year, 7 months, and 
4 days.<br>
Little Adrian was the only child, and only those who have felt, that devotion 
almost akin to idolatry, which is sometimes characteristic of parents toward 
their only child, can begin to appreciate the depth of grief into which these 
fond parents are plunged n account of the loss of their child who was a 
well-spring of joy, and intelligent far beyond his years.<br>
The burial took place at Maplewood Tuesday afternoon a half past two o'clock, 
with services by Rev. W. J. Cherry. Mr. and Mrs. Briggs have our sincere 
sympathy, as well as that of their friends in Pulask and throughout the county.<br>

Allen was a sweet little boy of just only five sunny summers and was a great pet

this world of trouble to sweetly rest in heaven and be with his dear grandmother

BROWN, Mildred Edmondson The Pulaski Citizen 21 Dec 1916<br>
The death of Mrs. Mildred Edmondson Brown wife of Mr. Mahlon Brown has cast a 
gloom over the entire town of Lynnville, although she had only resided here 
since her marriage, May 11, 1913. She became so engrafted in our hears that her

was the a daughter of the Mr. and Mrs. Eihu and Cornelia Edmondson of Bethel, 
Tenn., was born March 27, 1886, joined the Methodist Church early in life was a 
member of the Woman's Missionary Society and had always been an active church 
worker.<br>
Death is always sad, but when the young are taken, who are so much appreciated 
we can't understand His dealings. From a human standpoint it seems hard that one 
so pure, so useful, and that in the morning of life she was called home. she had 
only been sick a few hours and the shock was great to her family, but God's 
grace is sufficient. She rest in peace. she as a quiet woman, a model 
house,keeper, a devoted wife, and a splendid neighbor. It had been my privilege 
to live in speaking distance of her two years, and only those who had such a 
neighbor and lost them know what it means. Her mother, two brothers and two 
sisters were with her when the death Angel called for her. The sympathy of the 
entire town goes out to the heart broken husband. Her remains were carried to 
Bethel Tuesday night and after funeral services conducted by J. K. Lee, at the 
Methodist Church, she was interred in the family graveyard, Wednesday Dec. 13. 
Her grave was banked with lovely flowers.<br>
&quot;Gone beyond this field of sorrow,<br>
Where many battles are won'<br>
Where earthly trials are over<br>
and sorrow never comes,<br>
Gone from this world of sorrow,<br>
Free from earthly care;<br>
Redeemed in Christ's redemption<br>
To dwell in a land of prayer.&quot;<br>

He had been for many years Register of Giles County. He was clever and

the office he had learned perhaps more of the records of Giles County real 
estate than any one else knew.<br>

Bunker Hill &quot;Tempest and Sunshine&quot;<br>
On Friday, Sept. 26, at her home, the Eden of her heart, the soul of Mrs. Mollie 
Brownlow was released from its suffering and was transported by her own angle 
over that bridge, death, which lay just at the end of that road of virtuous 
purity which she had traveled even from childhood days to that happy paradise of 
love. Her life was made up of meekness and humility. For many years her life has 
been one of affliction, but she endured her suffering with patience and 
calmness.<br>
Mrs. Brownlow leaves a husband and six children to mourn her loss. How they will 
miss her in her accustomed place, but they have a stronger tie in Heaven. the 
light has gone out from the home but is shines brighter there. God gives us our 
loved ones and for his own good purpose he takes them from us. May God comfort 
them in this sad hour of trouble.<br>
In the quiet country graveyard on Indian Creek, with funeral services by Brother 
Beasley, she was laid to rest. There she will remain as the days and nights go 
by and as the seasons come and go, loving hands will plant their tender and 
sweet scented flowers and growing trees in whose branches sweet throated birds 
will twitter and sing. Surrounded by the sweet influence of nature she will 
sleep on. Dear mother in Israel farewell, but not forever. She is gone earth is 
poorer but Heaven is richer.<br>

BUFFALO, Dewey The Pulaski Citizen 05 Oct 1905 In Memory<br>
If anything could have caused me especial pain it was the sad news of the death 
of Little Dewey Buffalo. Oh! how I remember that sweet little boy. Lovely, 
lively, intelligent and affectionate ever displaying a thouthfulness beyond his 
years. And to lose such a promising child truly brings a deep and heavy shadow. 
But oh! what a relief to our hearts when we can think and know that little Dewey 
is sweetly resting in the arms of Jesus.<br>
We can only look forward to the time when the light will break through and there 
will be a glad and happy reunion in the great beyond.<br>
It is sad indeed to part from our loved ones, but think of the one who careth 
for us all and loveth little children.<br>
He had prepared a bright and beautiful home beyond the grave, and the spirit of 
little Dewey will only wait a short time when in sweetness and in love he will 
meet his dear mother and father to depart no more forever. May God bless his 
loved ones in their hour of sorrow is the wish of his loving teacher. Bethel,

<br>
BUNCH, Otis The Pulaski Citizen 26 Jun 1902<br>
Otis Bunch, youngest son of Mrs. M. J. Bunch, who keeps the toll gate on the 
Brick Church pike has been working in Ensley, Ala., for sometime. Sunday morning 
about 3 o'clock, the house where he was boarding burned, and a telegram received 
here later in the day brought the sad news that his body had been found among 
the ruins. Jim and Walter Bunch, two older brothers, went on the first train, 
and brought the remains to Pulaski for burial. Funeral services were conducted 
Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock from the home of Will Bunch, another brother.<br>
Otis was 19 years and 7 months old, and had lived a quiet studious, industrious 
life. The<br>
Birmingham Age Herald of Monday gives the following report of the unfortunate 
occurrence:<br>
In the smoking ruins of the home of J. T. Fox, at Ensley the mutilated remains 
of Otis Bunch, a young electrician, were found yesterday morning shortly after 
daylight. The head was almost severed from the body, as if slashed with some 
sharp instrument, and the broken and distorted limbs separated from the 
unsightly trunk, were found in different parts of the room. When found the body 
was lying beside a wrecked piano, where it had fallen from the room above when 
the floor gave way to the flames.<br>
The house which was destroyed was a ten room structure, situated on the corner 
of Avenue D and Twenty-fourth street, and was occupied by Mr. Fox and family, 
who conducted a boarding house. Eighteen young men roomed at the house and all 
were asleep when the house was discovered ablaze. By leaping from upper story 
windows in their night clothes all of the young men escaped except young Bunch. 
Several of them sustained slight injuries and lost all their belongings.<br>
The flames were past control when they were discovered and the house and all its 
contents were destroyed. The loss is total as there was no insurance carried.<br>
When the inmates of the house had gotten together it was found that young Bunch, 
who is only nineteen years of age, was missing. A search of the ruins revealed, 
his dismembered body, horribly burned, in what had been the parlor.<br>
It was at first reported that he had started down the steps, but finding them on 
fire rushed back up the stairs into another young man's room with the hope of 
escaping from one of the windows. As he reached the center of the room the floor 
gave way and he was precipitated to the lower floor. Later this story could not 
be substantiated and on account of the mutilated condition of the body suspicion 
was aroused as to how he came to his death.<br>
The Ensley police are investigating the matter, but as yet have made no arrest. 
The officers say that it would have been impossible for the body to have been so 
dismembered merely by the fall. The theory is advanced that young Bunch was 
murdered and the house set on fire to hide the crime. No alarm was turned in 
until the structure was almost consumed.<br>
Otis Bunch came to Ensley from Pulaski, Tenn., several months ago and secured a 
position in the Ensley steel mills as an electrician. He was paid a big salary 
in full Saturday, but none of his money had been found, though it is possible it 
was burned in the fire.<br>
On account of the quick destruction of the house it was rumored that the 
structure may have been fired to secure the insurance money, but this was soon 
discarded as absurd because no insurance was carried.<br>
The entire affair is enveloped in mystery and the city attorney and police are 
working hard to solve it. No direct charges have been made against any 
individual, but on account of the horrible mutilation of the boy's body the 
authorities deemed an investigation necessary.<br>
James Bunch, a brother of the dead boy arrived last night and had the remains 
sent to Pulaski, Tennessee, where the funeral services will be held tomorrow.<br>
<br>
BURCH, Mary Mildred Black The Pulaski Citizen 07 Mar 1912<br>

Bernard, Will, Roy, and Solon, the latter residing in Texas.<br>

first born, they were very much devoted to their little rose bud, but alas, the 
midst of life, there is death and suffering to mar all or our pleasure, and if 
the Death Angel would consult us in regard to giving up husband or wife or 
brothers and sisters we would say no, but if he were to come to us and say we 
want to take that little darling boy or girl, we would say no a thousand times 
no, but the Lord, knows best, and while we love the children, he loves them too, 
and has a right to take them from the storms of temptations that wreck the soul, 
and from famine and wars, in fact and in short, out of a world of trouble and 
heartache and suffering, therefore we should say, Lord thy will be done, not 
ours. We greatly sympathize with Mr. and Mrs. Curtis and also Mr. Gill, and the 
good old father and mother. We sympathize with suffering humanity because we 
know what it is to suffer, and do does our Savior.<br>

all speak in the highest terms of him besides attesting in many ways their 
respect for him and their sorrow and sympathy on account of his unexpected death 
at the very threshold of a bright and successful life. He became early in life 
identified as a faithful member of Mt. Olivet Methodist Church and Sunday 
School, near Riversburg. He was always a steady sober minded, noble, sensible 
boy with a sufficient amount of wholesome good humor and liveliness about him.

him.<br>

before his death introduced his father to his nurse and a number of his friends 
who were standing sorrowfully by. He spoke of his boyhood days at Buford and

1847. She was married to William D. Fuller Feb. 4, 1869. Professed religion and 
joined the M. E. Church at Bee Spring the same year and lived a consistent 
member until the morning of July 17, 1900, when a winged messenger came from 
Heaven to say, &quot;Thy work on earth is ended and I have come to steer thee over 
the river.&quot; His summons did not frighten her, ah, no, for she had no hurried 
preparations to make, for her whole life had been attired in the garments of 
pure womanhood and christian living. The call was not an unexpected one, for she 
had been standing some time by the river's brink, and I suspect before the 
boatman's call she had heard his oars dip. She held life dear 'tis true: to many 
it is not sacred enough until the end comes. We do not make of it what we 
should. Mrs. Fuller said that it was her great desire to live and be with her 
husband and nephew, John Young; to whom she was all that a mother could be. And 
yet if it was the Father's will she was ready to obey. She suffered much through 
life and for two years her suffering had become intense. But still she bore it 
patiently and longed to live.<br>
She left upon this side of eternity to mourn her loss a loving husband, two 
sisters, four brothers, and many relatives and friends. In years gone by father 
and mother, five brothers and one sister had gone on before her. It is always 
thus with those who have spent as much as two score and a half fleeting years 
upon earth. 'Tis only to leave a number of loved ones here to meet a greater 
number in the life beyond.....<br>
After an impressive funeral service, conducted by Rev. J. J. Shaw, the remains 
were laid to rest to await the resurrection morn.<br>

morning and the remains were placed in the cemetery nearby. The Rev. D. T. 
Foust, pastor of the Baptist Church of Pulaski, in the absence of the regular 
pastor who was detained by sickness, conducted the funeral services.<br>
From far and near the friends gathered at the church until there were no empty 
seats and many were standing up.<br>
Of her it could be said, she was devoted to her family, with whom she desired to 
remain, and her church of which she had been a faithful, consistent member since 
her fourteenth year. She had been the organist of the church and Sunday School 
and had engaged in teaching a class in the Sunday School prior to her sickness.<br>
Her hands were always ready to do any good act, therefore she will be missed. 
She is survived by her husband and two daughters who have the sympathy of a host 
of friends.<br>

HARRIS, Robert Simpson The Pulaski Citizen 6 Feb 1913<br>
Another landmark passed away from the trials and troubles of a world of unrest 
Monday night, when Robert Simpson Harris died at his home near Kedron. Up to 
several months ago, Mr. Harris, though 87 years old, was actively engaged in the 
pursuits of his farm. Since that time he had slowly weakened until the final 
dissolution came. Mr. Harris was a devout member of the Methodist church, having 
connected himself with that denomination early in life. He was a good, quiet 
generous man, and died as he had lived, an honest man and noble Christian 
gentleman.<br>
Mr. Harris leaves a wife, with whom he had lived in happy wedlock fifty-seven 
years, besides a large family of children and relatives, the children numbering 
nine. There are Mrs. Nathan Eubanks of Aspen Hill; Mrs. Henry Malone of 
Lynnville; Mrs. Claude Ball, Athens, Ala.; Mrs. T. T. Newbill, Tarpley; Messrs. 
Robert, Alfred, R. H. (Dick), Drs. John and Will. Rev. Robert J. Craig preached 
the funeral at the residence Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock, and all that was 
mortal of Robert S. Harris was laid in the cemetery at Pleasant Hill.<br>
The Citizen extends sympathy to the bereaved ones.<br>
<br>
I want to offer my humble tribute to the memory of that excellent Christian man, 
Charlie Harwell, who died Dec. 18, 1909, aged 40 years, 9 months, after 
lingering seven weeks with typhoid fever. He professed religion at Pisgah when 
only sixteen years of age and lived a consistent Christian life. He was a man of 
fine character, with a kind and sweet disposition, always cheerful and seemed to 
be happy, and tried to make everybody about him happy. Of course, he had his 
troubles like other men, also sorrow and grief, temptations and disappointments 
but was so confident of the fact that &quot;all things work together for good to 
those that love the Lord,&quot; that he always looked on the bright side of every 
thing. He was always willing and ready to help those that needed help. He was 
conscious until the very last and left this testimony. &quot;I'm going home; the 
battle has been fought and the victory won, and I can meet God in peace.&quot; With 
true Christian heroism he approached the grave, &quot;like one who wraps the drapery 
of his couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams.&quot; When the end came it 
was sweetly calm and beautifully peaceful. Tis a sad thought to realize that he 
is dead, but we must not think of him as being dead, but just sleeping. How 
sweet it is for him to awake in that beautiful home on high, where parting, 
sickness, sorrow and death will never come.<br>
May God bless the wife, father, mother, brother and sisters and help them to 
realize that God, &quot;doeth all things well.&quot;<br>

Thursday afternoon the spirit of John R. Holt took its flight, and the struggle 
between life and death which had been going on with doubtful result for several 
weeks was ended.<br>
The strong man with finely developed muscular body had become weak as a little 
child before the end came, but the mind was clear to the last. He had an attack 
of typhoid fever, and before he had regained enough strength to withstand 
another serious illness an abscess formed on the liver, causing death.<br>
John R. Holt, was a son of Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Holt, of Goodspring. He married 
several years ago, Miss Metta Garner, daughter of Abe Garner and by his death a 
widowed mother and three children are left in sorrow.<br>

<br>
HOLT, Sarah Fogg The Pulaski Citizen 15 Aug 1912<br>
Friends of the family were greatly shocked Sunday to learn of the sudden death 
of Mrs. R. W. Holt at her home near Good Springs.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Holt was apparently well as usual Saturday. She was over at the store 
conducted by her sons, returning home in the afternoon, and retiring as usual at 
night. Mr. Holt was awake about 10 o'clock and that time did not notice anything 
wrong. He awoke again at 2 o'clock and was horrified to fine Mrs. Holt cold in 
death. She had passed away probably without a struggle between 11 o'clock and 2 
o'clock. She had on former occasions had slight attacks of heart trouble, and it 
is supposed the tire heart just quietly ceased to beat and the brittle thread of 
life snapped.<br>
It was one of the saddest, most pathetic scenes when her stalwart sons assembled 
at the home Sunday morning and realized that mother was gone. We have on other 
occasions remarked upon this unusual family-a large family of boys, all grown to 
manhood and each a magnificent specimen of large, vigorous manly men. And to see 
these men shaken with sorrow at the bedside of her who for many years has been 
the centre and idol of the home, was a scene that filled the eyes of strong men 
with tears, and their heart with sympathy.<br>
After funeral services at Cedar Grove Monday conducted by her pastor, J. K. Lee, 
assisted by Rev. John Durrett, long a friend and neighbor of the family, the 
remains were interred at the Fogg Cemetery. The funeral was attended by a large 
crowd and many beautiful florals attested the popularity of this good woman.<br>
Quite a number of people went out from Pulaski to attend the funeral, and to pay 
a last tribute of respect and to mingle tears of sympathy with those of the 
bereaved family.<br>

HOUSTON, F. N. The Pulaski Citizen 26 Mar 1914 Bradshaw and McBurg &quot;Dr. Love&quot;<br>
On March 17th, 1914, Esq. Houston surrendered all claims on mortality. He was 
born at Lewisburg, Marshall County, December 8, 1836, which makes him a little 
over seventy seven years old at the time of his death. He was in the Civil War, 
after which he came to Pulaski, and was in the revenue department four years.<br>
In 1866, he was married to Miss Sarah Abernathy, and to this union ten children 
were born, eight daughters and two sons, all of whom survive. But Miss Colle is 
the only single child at home. After leaving Pulaski, he located at Bradshaw and 
was elected magistrate in 1882, and served in that capacity twenty-four years. 
This proves that he was very popular with the people. He became a good judge of 
law, and his counsel was sought. He was a strong man physically, mentally and 
his personality commanded respect.<br>
He professed faith in Christ about thirty years ago, and has been a faithful 
soldier of the Cross as a member of the Baptist Church at Center Point.<br>
<br>
On Tuesday he was at Bradshaw store and took dinner with his son, Bud Houston 
and wife and walked home in the afternoon, took a seat by the fire and told his 
wife that he felt better. But in a few minutes Mrs. Houston, who was seated near 
by, heard him make a noise, she then spoke to him, but he made no answer. She 
called her daughter, but all was over, the Lamp of Life had gone out, leaving 
his wife and daughter alone in their solitude.<br>
A large crowd attended the funeral, which was conducted by Rev. J. H. Holmes and 
Maut Harwell at Zion. Much sympathy is extended to the bereaved family, and may 
the hand of God's providence guide them to the end.<br>

time, but her sudden death was totally unexpected and caused a shock to all her

A. J. &quot;Uncle Jack&quot; Jones, as he was familiarly called by his friends, died 
suddenly at his home near Minor Hill, Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock, his 
sudden death being a sincere shock to his neighbors. He had not been feeling 
well for a day or two, but was up going around the place, looking after some 
work. He ate dinner as usual on Saturday and went to his bed and lay down. When 
some member of the family went to arouse him they found that he was dead. Heart 
trouble is said to have been the cause. Mr. Jones was over 83 years old, and had

The husband and children will miss her in the accustomed place. Home is lonely

Whereas, it has pleased an All wise God in His infinite goodness and mercy to 
take from our number in the Bee Spring Sunday school on Friday, August 9, 1901, 
Solon Loyd, and while we submit to the dealings of a Divine Providence in His 
wonderful ways with the childen of men, we bow our heads in sorrow , and while 
our hearts bleed, pause this Sabbath morning at the new made grave of our 
comrade to strew fresh flowers of affection thereon.<br>
We feel that Solon's death is only a departure and his absence from our number 
means his presence in the great Sunday school where the friend of children is 
the teacher and the Savior of man is the superintendent.<br>
The intermediate department of our school will not only miss the presence and 
magnetism he gave but will long for the force of character that he put in every 
interest of that department.<br>

nature, at the advanced age of eighty-three.<br>
Mrs. Maples was the widow of Malcolm G. Maples, for many years one of the 
wealthiest and most successful farmers, living in the north west part of the 
county, near Bethel, Tenn. She was a Gilbert before she was wedded to the man 
with whom she lived for more than fifty years, a member of the leading family of 
the southern part of Giles County. She was a woman of most excellent qualities, 
both of head and heart. She reared a large family, all of whom but two 
daughters, Mrs. Gipson and Miss Carrie Maples, have passed over the river and 
were waiting the coming of the old mother, who has been patiently waiting the 
summons for many weary months.<br>
Mrs. Maples leaves a number of devoted grandchildren, to whom she was greatly 
attached, and who made her declining years very happy by their loving care and 
dutiful attention. No wish of hers ever went ungratified if it were at all 
possible and when the last hours came they surrounded her couch and watched the 
flickering of the spark that kept the feeble body lit with life, until at last 
the flash went out and they had only left the old tenement of clay.<br>
Her remains were carried to the Gilbert graveyard in Giles County, near Bethel, 
Tenn., where sleeps the husband of whom she plighted her trothin the full bloom 
of a beautiful young womanhood, and children whom she reared and saw go out 
before her time to depart, are buried. There she was laid away and her mound 
covered with fragrant flowers of the early spring, but her memory will ever live 
in the hearts of her children and grandchildren, and her life and character will 
be an inspiration to those who are left behing. To emulate her life will be a 
sufficient guarantee of a life of devotion and self-sacrifice on the part of 
those who mourn her death.----Alabama Courier<br>

MAY, Thomas Haywood The Pulaski Citizen 18 Jan 1912<br>
The many friends here of Thomas Haywood May were shocked Monday morning to learn 
of his sudden death which took place about half past 9 o'clock at his home on 
South Third Street.<br>
Mr. May had arisen as usual, and after eating breakfast complained of a pain in 
his left side and decided to lie down on his bed awhile. One of his daughters 
prepared a mustard plaster which he applied. The young lady had occasion to 
leave the room a short while afterward and on her return found that her father 
had quietly passed into the peaceful sleep of death.<br>
Mr. May had been a great sufferer with rheumatism for the past year or more and 
it is presumed that the disease affected his heart.<br>
He assisted at Murray &amp; Bennett's jewelry store during the Christmas trade and 
seemed to be better than for some time past.<br>

various vacations (sic), being in the furniture business here and at Decatur, 
more recently being connected with the Nashville<br>
Bottling Works. He traveled two or three years for the Sward Medicine Co.<br>
Mr. May was a man of genial disposition and affable manner and was always very 
popular. He was eight times elected Mayor of Pulaski, the last time being in 
1901. That he retained his popularity was shown in the recent race for Mayor 
which he lost by only five votes.<br>
Thomas H. May was a warm-hearted, whole-souled man, who has many good deeds and 
acts of kindness to his credit, and although he must have suffered much in the 
past year or two, he strove to keep up his jovial disposition and not worry 
others with his troubles.<br>

their sorrow and especially is this true of the six bright dutiful orphaned 
daughters, including Mrs. John H. Black.<br>

After a brave fight with disease lasting through more than three weeks, little 
Josephine McGrew, youngest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Irvin McGrew, quietly passed 
away at 8 o'clock yesterday morning.<br>
About twenty five days ago she was taken sick with typhoid fever. That, in a 
violent form, was bad enough, but later pneumonia developed. All that love and 
care and the skill of physicians could suggest, was done for her. But the 
overtaxed little heart failed, and the sweet, gentle, affectionate spirit took 
flight to God.<br>
Little Josephine was one of the most lovable children it has been our good 
fortune to know. Blessed with good health and a bright sunny disposition, she 
was light hearted and jolly, kind and affectionate. She was unselfish to a 
remarkable degree, and even as a playful little child, found great pleasure in 
contributing to the happiness of others. Only those who have suffered a similar 
loss, know how to sympathize with the heart broken parents in such sad 
bereavement.<br>
The funeral will be conducted from the residence at 10 o'clock this morning with 
services by Dr. Richardson.<br>

cheerful heart and with Christian faith and fortitude.<br>
Mrs. McGrew was a woman of superior intelligence and good judgement and was 
generous and kind hearted, and will be remembered by many for her good deeds.

MOORE, Tom White The Pulaski Citizen 1 Jan 1914<br>
Tom W. Moore died at Leesburg, Fla., Saturday afternon. He went there several 
weeks ago for the benefit of the mild climate, but grew so ill that his 
father-in-law, J. A. White, went to be with him, or to bring him home. He was 
not able to make the trip home and a message was sent to Mrs. Moore to come. She 
started Saturday but was intercepted at Montgomery with a message that her 
father and Tom would leave Leesburg for Pulaski early Sunday morning, so she 
returned home before the purport of the message was made known to her.<br>
Tom W. Moore was thirty-one years of age, a son of the late Asa W. Moore, and no 
young man ever grew up in Pulaski who had brighter prospects than he had. He was 
a model boy of clean life and no bad habits. He was the idol of a widowed mother 
and three sisters in the home, and at a very young age was given a responsible 
position in the Commercial Bank. This position he filled with credit to himself 
and to the satisfaction of the bank. He was popular socially, and active in 
church work where for many years he sang in the choir at the Methodist Church.<br>
When in the early morning of young manhood he led Miss Lucile White to the 
marriage alter, every one who knew them both thought how fitting that two young 
people so congenial in every way and so well suited to each other should walk 
hand in hand down the pathway of life.<br>
In consequence of a reorganization he was tendered and accepted the responsible 
position of cashier of one of the banks at Lynnville and held this position to 
the entire satisfaction of all concerned till his health failed.<br>
Consumption, that dread disease which lays its blighting fingers on such a large 
percentage of the human family, took deep hold upon him, and notwithstanding 
many trips to the mountains and to a milder climate, and all that the affection 
of loved ones and the interest of friends could suggest, was attempted, the 
disease progressed steadily to the end.<br>
The body accompanied by Mr. White reached Pulaski Monday evening. After funeral 
services at the residence Thursday afternoon at 1:30 o'clock conducted by Rev. 
T. C. Ragsdale, the remains were tenderly laid away in Maplewood Cemetery.<br>
The deceased is survived by his wife and a little son to whom much sympathy is 
extended, as well as the mother and sisters and an older brother.<br>
<br>
MORRIS, William Bartley The Pulaski Citizen 16 Jun 1926<br>

The burial took place at Moriah with the funeral service conducted by his 
pastor, Dr. M. S. Kennedy, assisted by Rev. J. L. Taylor of Prospect at the 
Wales Church of which he was a member also an elder.<br>
Mr. Morris was greatly respected and loved by the people of his community and 
numbered his friends by the score. When almost too weak to speak he requested 
that each friend who called to see him, be admitted to his room.<br>
He was a successful farmer, stockman and seemed to have unusual ability in 
dealing with hired laborers.<br>
He was a member of the Junior Order and at one time a member of the County 
Court.<br>
As long as his health permitted he took an active part in all community and 
county affairs. But by nature he was a home loving man and his greatest 
pleasures were the beautifying of his home and surroundings and the 
companionship of his family.<br>
More than forty years ago he was married to Miss Sallie Tidwell, daughter of the 
late J. P. Tidwell, who survives him. He is also survived by four children as 
follows: Turner, Flournoy, Newton of the Wales community, and Mrs. Oscar Watson 
of Pulaski.<br>
Although a sufferer for many months he was patient and kind to all and very 
appreciative of even the least thing that could be done for his comfort.<br>
Several days before the end came he expressed a desire to go to his Heavenly 
home, where he said, God had placed him and often when too weak to speak aloud 
there was the faint whisper, &quot;Happy, happy, happy.&quot;<br>

REED, Carl Hyde The Pulaski Citizen 8 Feb 1900<br>
Prospect-It is our painful duty to record the demise of Carl Hyde Reed, who 
departed this life Feb. 2, 1900. To the mistress who cared for him so tenderly 
in his declining years, he was the link that bound the happy days of girlhood to 
the happier ones of matronhood. So aside from the many noble traits he 
possessed. Carl embodied those memories of the past which we all cherish, and 
with which we are so loath to part. Now that Carl's mission here is ended we can 
find no more fitting uncommon than &quot;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&quot;<br>

RICE, H. S. The Pulaski Citizen 22 Mar 1900<br>
Bunker Hill---On Friday, Feb. 23, Mrs. H. S. Rice was taken violently sick and 
lived till Tuesday, Feb. 27. She battled bravely against the disease, whic was 
bronchitis, but all in vain. Her frail constitution could not withstand longer 
the combined attack and she fell asleep as peacefully as a child. She was the 
youngest daughter of Martin and Harriet Baugh, two of our oldest settlers, who 
came from Virginia years ago. She is the last sister of Mary S. Brooks, and the 
eleventh child, nine of whom have survived her. Years ago Mrs. Rice was twice 
married, first, to A. D. Watson, of Memphis; and moved from there to Missouri, 
where he died. She then moved from there to Northport, Ala., where she again 
married to John Rice and lived very happy till about two years ago, and the 
silent reaper, Death, came and garnered from the field her last husband and she 
again was left alone without children to comfort her. Aunt Harriet, we should 
call her, was a member of the Missionary Baptist Church. The deceased possessed 
one of the beautiful Christian characters that lived only to benefit her fellow 
beings. She was beloved and honored by all. She leaves a rich heritage-the 
memory of a perfect woman hood. We well know that she has passed through the 
gates to peace and joy.<br>
<br>

<br>
RIVERS, Julian The Pulaski Citizen 22 Feb 1900<br>
Many hearts were saddened Tuesday morning when it became known that Julian 
Rivers was dead. His critical illness had been known for several days but 
friends here hoped he would survive. So while the message announcing his death 
was not unexpected it was none the less a cause of sincere sorrow among his many 
friends, here and elsewhere throughout the State. Julian was an exceedingly 
lovable young man, and those who knew him well were very much attached to him. 
Probably no young man in this county ever had more really warm personal friends.<br>
<br>
Mr. Rivers entered the hospital on Feb.13, suffering from an aggravated attack 
of pneumonia and little or no hope was entertained of his recovery from the 
first day. The sickness was rendered doubly dangerous from the fact that all his 
life he had suffered from weakness of the heart's action.<br>
Having died of pneumonia at 12:20 a. m., Tuesday at the City Hospital in 
Nashville, the body was brought to Pulaski for burial on the noon train Tuesday 
accompanied by a number of friends and relatives.<br>
The funeral services were conducted by the Rev. Granville Allison at the home of 
Flournoy Rivers yesterday morning at 11:30 o'clock immediately after the arrival 
of the Nashville train. The burial was at Maplewood Cemetery. The pallbearers 
were: Z. W. Ewing, James T. Oakes, Foster Yarbrough, T. P. Holt, W. M. Lane, 
George Wallen, W. C. Morgan, and N. B. White.<br>
Julian Rivers was born and raised in District 12 of this county. On reaching 
manhood he was several yearsbook keeper in the Peoples National and in the 
Citizens National Banks of this place. At the age of 23 years upon Mr. Craig's 
election as State Treasurer, he accompanied him to Nashville in January, 1893 as 
his chief clerk. This clerkship he has filled ever since. Mr. Craig had 
previously been Cashier of the Peoples National Bank of this place where he 
learned to know and appreciate the excellent business ability of Mr. Rivers.<br>
During his services from 1893 to 1900, under State Treasurer Craig, Mr. Rivers 
had handled for him and for the State some $20,000,000 of public money to his 
chief's entire satisfaction and approval.<br>
Mr. Rivers was the youngest son of William and Julia Flournoy Rivers, of this 
county, both of whom predeceased him, and he leaves his older brothers, Flournoy 
Rivers, of this place; Capt. Tyree Rivers, Fourth Cavalry; Lieut. William C. 
Rivers, First Cavalry; now Adjutant of the Military Academy, and one younger 
sister, Mrs. Myra Rivers Horn, the wife of Lieut. Tirmann N. Horn, First 
Artillery, U. S. A. now stationed at Fort Barraness, Pensacola, Fla., Capt. 
Rivers was not present at his brother's death, being on duty in the Phillipines.<br>
<br>
RIVERS, William Wilkins The Pulaski Citizen 11 Jan 1900<br>
William Wilkins Rivers, son of Mr. and Mrs. James Rivers, died at his home in 
Pulaski at 11:15 o'clock Thursday, Jan. 4, 1900, aged 35 years, 7 months and 20 
days, after an illness of about three weeks with typhoid fever. Funeral services 
were conducted at the Episcopal church at 2 o'clock Friday afternoon by Rev. 
Granville Allison, assisted by Rev. Marion S. Kennedy, after which the mortal 
remains of one of the best and most popular young men in Giles County were laid 
to rest in Maplewood.<br>
Will Rivers didn't have an enemy in the world. A man of his warm and human heart 
and genial nature couldn't have enemies. There was no malice in his heart and he 
was too high-minded to harbor base or little thoughts. The elements of true 
nobility were strongly blended in his character. He was a devoted and 
affectionate kinsman and a loyal friend. Once, while he was a deputy sheriff, he 
said to the writer: &quot;I am going to resign. I cannot bear to do certain things 
which my office requires of me,&quot; and he did resign.<br>
He was a young man of intelligence and possessed splendid business 
qualifications, and from his exhaustless fund of good nature there bubbled a 
continued fountain of humor which was the source of much innocent amusement to 
himself and friends. Will Rivers will be sadly missed, and only a few will 
lament him more than his friends in the country-those with whom he worked and 
joked and sympathized before he came to town to live, and the Citizen extends to 
the sorrowing family and friends a full measure of sympathy and regret on 
account of his death.<br>
<br>
ROCHELLE, Dave The Pulaski Citizen 12 Apr 1900<br>
Elkton-Elkton is in deep mourning since the tragical death of Mr. Dave Rochelle, 
which occurred at Columbia last Saturday night. Mr. Rochelle was an employee of 
the L. &amp; N. and it is supposed he fell between the cars when stepping from one 
to the other. The crew on the train from which he fell knew nothing of this 
until it reached Franklin. By that time four freight trains had passed over the 
body. The remains were interred near her Monday afternoon with Masonic honors 
deceased was for some time a salesman at the A. G Ezell house, and no young man 
was more popular and correct than he. His death is particularly sad. Being so 
young, 28 years and having been married only eleven months.<br>
<br>
RODDIE, Marco The Pulaski Citizen 12 Apr 1900<br>
Bunker Hill---On April 7, the infant babe of Mr. and Mrs. Reuben Roddie quietly 
passed into sweet life beyond, aged 7 months and one day. Marco was a sweet 
innocent little babe and was as smart a child as I ever saw to be so young. 
Little Marco had been suffering untold agony for the last two weeks with 
whooping cough and pneumonia and fatal results followed, carrying the little 
infant to its long, long home. The first link has been broken in this once happy 
family circle and the shadows rest deeply where recently all was sunshine. 
Loving parents and kind friends did all they could, but God took him home to be 
with loved ones gone on before. If he had lived he would have been subjected to 
the sins and sorrows of life. The funeral services were conducted by Rev. Shaw, 
of Elkton, at the homestead, after which he was carried to Pisgah and laid to 
rest to await the resurrection morn.<br>
<br>
ROSE, William Solon The Pulaski Citizen 5 Apr 1900<br>

honesty and uniformly courteous and considerate treatment which he accorded to 
others made him popular with all with whom he came in contact. His private life

a wise but indulgent counsellor.<br>
Surviving Mr. Rose, are the wife who stood by him so truly throughout the long 
period of their wedded life, three manly sons, and three gentle and amiable 
daughters who have the truest sympathy of a large number of friends throughout 
the county, as have the other relatives, who lament the goodman's death.<br>

father could be to those boys.<br>
After the funeral services, conducted by Brother J. J. Shaw, his body was laid 
to rest in the family graveyard, there to await Christ's summons for the grave 
to give up its dead.<br>

The writer was deeply pained to learn of the death of Reed Smith. He was a young 
man of exceptional intellect, and high mechanic talent. He was a useful citizen, 
and a man of high thought and was progressive, quick to perceive. His death is a 
loss to the public aside from the terrible blow to his family.<br>
<br>
SMITH, Sarah Frances Abernathy The Pulaski Citizen 18 Feb 1909<br>
Mrs. R. Monroe Smith died Saturday at her home in Pulaski, aged about 69 years. 
Mrs. Smith had not been in good health for the past three or four years, but 
being a woman of great energy and will power she continued about her household 
duties and bore her suffering uncomplaining.<br>
She was the daughter of Colston Abernathy and is survived by a very large family 
connection, being a sister of Cope Abernathy of Texas, and Mesdames Mary Jane 
Carden, Elise McCormick, Lizzie Elder and Adelaide Birdsong of Giles County.<br>
Mrs. Smith is survived by her husband whom she married 53 years ago, and six 
children; Robert C., Arnie and Orman Smith, and Mesdames Ed L. Roberts, Olanda 
Bennett, and R. H. Hudgens of Nashville.<br>
Mrs. Smith was a devoted wife and mother, a model neighbor, and a woman who 
exemplified the highest type of Christianity in her daily life, having long been 
a consistent member of the Methodist Church.<br>
Impressive funeral services were conducted at the residence by Rev. G. A. Morgan 
Sunday afternoon in the presence of a large concourse of sorrowing relatives and 
friends, followed by the interment in Maplewood Cemetery, many beautiful floral 
tokens being offered as a last act of friendship and esteem.<br>
Unassuming and unpretentious, a woman of excellent judgment and charitable 
impulses, her good deeds will long live in the memory of many who have received 
kindness at her hands, and after a long life of unselfish usefulness, it is 
meant that she should cross over the river and rest in the shade of the trees.<br>

STEVENSON, Coleman Lafayette The Pulaski Citizen 12 Nov 1908 &quot;Memorial&quot;<br>
The following caper was read at the Memorial service of the Bee Spring Sunday 
School, held in memory of the late C. L. Stevenson last Sunday morning.<br>
It is with sad hearts that we pause today in our regular Sabbath School work and 
pay a tribute to one who has long stood in our ranks.<br>
C. L. Stevenson was born Dec. 26, 1832, and on the morning of Oct. 24, 1908 his 
spirit entered through the portals of eternal life.<br>
He had spent almost four score years in the ever changing scenes of life's 
battles and his death was like the laying down of arms, when the soldier hero 
retires from the fields of victory glory crowned.<br>
He has always been a citizen of Giles County and though Giles is largely 
populated with men of sterling worth we know that C. L. Stevenson ranked with 
her best.<br>
He was married 3 times, first to Miss Louisa Jackson who died early after the 
marrige. She was the mother of his son W. B. Stevenson.<br>
His second marriage was to Miss Dorcas Jackson. The remained in wedlock for a 
period of many years, when death took her from him. She was the mother of his 
three sons, J. M., E. A. and T. M. Stevenson.<br>
His last marriage was to Mrs. William Tungett, who survives him.<br>
Besides these four sons he has reared no less than twelve orphans, and for a 
period of forty years he has had an orphan under his fatherly care and at time 
there has been as many as four in his home at the same time. In God's word we 
read: &quot;Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit 
the father less and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted 
from the world.&quot;<br>
For a period of sixty four years he has been a member of the Methodist Church, 
and for fifty years a steward in the church.<br>
He came of an honorable family. A noble lineage was his and in the very 
beginning of life, there was the foundation where on to build a character which 
was strong like Gibraltar's rock. A character that stood the test of time, a 
character clean, pure and ideal.<br>
He did not have the advantage which some men have of an extended scholastic 
education, and yet his education died comprise those essentials which make a man 
or woman fitted for life.<br>
It disciplined his feelings, it inspired true and worthy motives. It inspired a 
profound religious feeling. It inculcated pure morality and purity of life, and 
these embrace, the large term of education.<br>
Every one knows him to be kind and true. All appreciate him and honored him. He 
was looked to for aid and depended upon him when help was needed. He was truly a 
man of great usefulness.<br>
As an agriculturist he was well skilled and the result was, prosperity awaited 
his labors. But be it said to his credit, that liberality in the furtherance of 
every good when it required means, was a true characteristic of him.<br>
Whereas, it has pleased God to remove from us our beloved co-worker in Sunday, 
C. L. Stevenson.<br>
Therefore be it Resolved, That while we know that we have sustained a loss 
severe indeed, yet we are consoled by the thought, that as a school we have been 
wonderfully blessed by having his noble character before us as open book so long 
a time. 2nd, That we believe that the influence for good arising from his 
honorable life, will not cease to live, but will continue to widen out as the 
wave set in motion spreads over the bosom of the lake. 3rd, That as a Sunday 
School we extend the sorrowing ones our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.<br>

Loyd, at Memphis at 6:30 o'clock Sunday evening, Feb. 21, at the age of 85 years

Loyd, near Memphis, and in accordance with his wishes was sent here for burial 
Tuesday.<br>

and quite a number of friends and relatives remember him well and with the 
utmost kindness.<br>
Several years ago he sold out his home and went to live with his children who 
had grown up, married and made their homes elsewhere. But he never ceased to 
love the home and friends of earlier days and often expressed a wish that when 
the time should come in might be brought back to Bee Spring for burial. The body 
was accompanied by two sons, J. J. and J. B. Stevenson who live in Mississippi, 
and was met here by friends and relatives from Bryson. After the funeral service 
at Bee Spring the remains were buried with Masonic honor by the Bradshaw lodge 
where he had retained his membership for many years.<br>
Mr. Stevenson leaves of his immediate family four children, two boys, John B. 
and Jesse J., of Marshall County, Miss., and Mrs. S. B. Loyd, of Shelby county; 
at whose home he died; also Dr. E. H. Stevenson, of Ft. Smith, Ark., as well as 
a widowed companion who had traveled life's journey with him for over a half 
century. her maiden name was Abernathy, a relic of the family of that name in 
this county. To her the stroke must fall heaviest and to her it must seem that 
all the fondest hopes, brightest joys and sweetest treasures of earth are 
forever gone.<br>

STORY, Moses Sidney The Pulaski Citizen 09 Jan 1913<br>
Moses Sidney Story died at Bryson on Jan. the 1st, 1913, after several weeks 
lingering with a complication of troubles incident to the infirmities of age. 
Had Mr. Story lived till the 22nd of February he would have been 85 years old.

consistent member of the same, and had been an elder of that denomination 40 
years, and belonged to the Young's Chapel congregation since its organization.<br>
Coming home from the confederate army with an honorable discharge after four

<br>
STOVALL, Thomas Marshall The Pulaski Citizen 5 Aug 1909<br>
Unlike the babbling brook of the green meadow or the bounding, noisy stream of 
the rugged mountain, the life of Thomas Marshall Stovall was more like the 
moving tide in the current of a great river. He pursued the unbroken even tenor 
of his way in a manner that was not noisy or attractive, but with the deep 
intonations of force that was felt and moved things when put in action.<br>
He first saw the light of day in the Bryson vicinity and spent his long life of 
about 72 years there closing it on July the 14th 1909. His physical frame had 
been giving away for more than a year under the ravages of a disease that had 
been preying upon his system, but not until the cyclone that passed over the 
community on the night of April the 29th, did seemingly serious trouble set in. 
He was in the midst of the direful calamity and a severe looser thereby and the 
wreckage and ruin proved too much for his enfeebled condition. The sudden and 
unexpected shock was so severe upon him that he never rallied fully from its 
effects. Not that he sustained any personal injuries but the loss in destruction 
of his property and the partial devastation of his home so impaired his vitality 
and knocked the spring out os his once responsive nature that he soon began to 
wane and continued to go down until the end came.<br>
He was married in young manhood to Sarah E. Stevenson and this honored companion 
and devoted wife of a half century, with Sterling E. and two daughters, Mesdames 
Emma Watson and Addie Moore and several grandchildren with one brother and some 
sisters survive him.<br>
Converted in early life to the Christian religion he soon thereafter joined the 
Methodist Church, South, at Bee Spring and served therein during the time all 
the relations of a lay official in the local church to which he belonged.<br>
He taught school for several years when quite a young man, but he was so modest 
and unassuming in his manner that but few, if any of his most intimate friends 
and neighbors of the present day knew of this fact. His store of knowledge upon 
general subjects was above that of the average citizen and I cannot refrain from 
saying just here that a sacred historian and to any inquiring after truth and 
light he was an exponent equal to any man in the range of my acquaintance.<br>
The removal from the waslks of men of such a life always gives me profound 
regret and especially is this true when I think of the direction in which we are 
tending, the rapidity with which we are moving and the glare and glitter that 
gives that which we call life a superficial tinsel of veneering with son little 
of profound reality. A few more like passages and the last lingering remains 
will have gone from among us of that primitive class of herald noblemen who wove 
the texture of true manhood and womanhood into the warp and woof of that element 
that today constitutes the bone and sinew of our great country. Therefore I 
write this epitaph as a tribute of respect and appreciation for the long, 
peaceful, unpretentious life of this good man and honored citizen that has 
fallen among us. John H. Stevenson<br>

Mr. Tarpley is survived by several children including Mrs. Beverly Brown and Ed

TAYLOR, Mamie Creecy The Pulaski Citizen 1 Mar 1900<br>
Diana-On last Friday morning at 4 o'clock Mrs. Mamie Taylor, daughter of Mr. and 
Mrs. J. H. Creecy, died of typhoid fever. She has passed from this world of sin 
and sorrow to a bright and happy land prepared for those who lived as she lived.

room for you. Burial services were conducted by Rev. J. M. Oakly.<br>
<br>
TENERY, James The Pulaski Citizen 23 Mar 1905 Bunker Hill &quot;Pansil&quot; A TRIBUTE<br>
Mr. James Tennery approached the grave and passed out into the great beyond 
March 16, 1905. Tired nature could hold out no longer, his constitution was 
shattered and worn out. He had spent about four score years in the ever changing 
scenes of life's battle and his death was but as the calm retiring of a soldier 
hero all glory covered from its fields of victory.<br>
It was noonday when he passed away and while it was dark and gloomy to loved 
ones left behind all was beautiful, bright and grand to him as he entered the 
portal's of that celestial city.<br>
We always look upon death with horror but what is it but the gateway to eternal 
joy? Those who have lived as long as Mr. Tennery, always have more friends and 
loved ones in heaven than here, if we but take the census and number those who 
have departed and those yet remain we find this to be indeed true.<br>
He seemed to hold sweet converse with his wife and loved ones confident that he 
would soon join them.<br>
For many years he had faithfully served the master and was known as a man of a 
warm heart and Christian spirit. After an impressive funeral service conducted 
by Mr. J. M. Bass he was laid to rest in the Bee Spring Cemetery. Peace to his 
ashes.<br>
<br>
TENNERY, Thomas J. The Pulaski Citizen 21 Feb 1901<br>
Mr. James Tennery received a letter a few days ago from Texas, bringing the sad 
news of the death of his oldest brother, Mr. Thos. J. Tennery, who died at 
Italy, Texas, Jan. 19, 1901.<br>
Mr. Tennery was born on Buchanan Creek, near Parson Reed's old home, April 26, 
1816, making him 84 years, 8 months and 25 days old. Mr. Jas. Tennery, his 
brother, wishes a small notice of his death in his family paper, the Pulaski 
Citizen, for his and the older citizens' benefit of this county.<br>
Thos. J. Tennery moved to Texas during the year 1843, has lived in Texas 58 
years. Times in Texas in those days were what we might term tough, and a man to 
live there then had to have a good spinal column to stand the racket. When he 
first went to Texas he wore rawhide shoes and at one time subsisted upon milk 
and meat without salt; could not get either meal or flour. Transportation was 
then difficult and doubtful, but he stayed and prospered and the world is better 
for having such men live in it.<br>
Thos. J. Tennery was the oldest boy of eight children of Wm. Daniel and Polly 
Tennery. His father had 12 children in all, four by second wife.<br>
<br>
Mr. Tennery was in the fight at San Jacinto and many other battles and 
Skirmishes under the immortal Sam Houston, for the independence of Texas, for 
which the State of Texas gave him a section of land. He was also a home guard 
under the Confederate government during our Civil War. His grandfather was a 
Revolutionary soldier. His brother, James Tennery, who lives near me, was also a 
soldier during the Civil War under that matchless chieftain, Gen. Bedford 
Forrest. He was his chief veterinary surgeon and is always glad to tell of 
incidents, trials and gallantry of his chief.<br>
So we can readily see that the Tennerys come from a family of patriots and 
soldiers. They are all sky blue Democrats, honest and true, always for the 
right. It is said of Thos. J. Tennery that he would walk two miles to pay you 10 
cents if he owed you.<br>
Thus, he lived and died, true to every exigency or emergency of life, an old man 
honored and respected by all who knew him. Peace be to the ashes of our friend 
who is now buried in Italy, Tex., whose slumber will know no waking till the 
resurrection morn. W. L. Holt, Bunker Hill<br>
<br>
THOMAS, Annie M. The Pulaski Citizen 15 Jun 1916<br>
A largely attended funeral was that of Mrs. Annie M. Thomas, held yesterday 
afternoon at the residence of Mrs. Tom Carden on Fifth Avenue where the deceased 
had made her home for a number of years.<br>
Rev. J. A. Foster, pastor of the West Side Presbyterian Church was assisted by

where she was born 77 years ago. At the age of 9 years she became a Christian 
and has always been active in church work.<br>
Thirty grandchildren survive her and seven children who are: E. L. Thomas, O. J. 
Thomas, J. D. Thomas, J. R. Thomas, of the Decaturs; Ike Thomas, Aspen Hill, 
Tenn.; Mrs. Sallie Rogers, Mrs. Tom Carden, Mrs. Bob Worley, of the Decaturs;

<br>
THOMAS, Mary V. Rose The Pulaski Citizen 29 Mar 1900<br>
Mrs. Mary V. Thomas, wife of Mitchell M. Thomas died at her home in Pulaski 
Sunday, March 25, after an illness of about two weeks of pneumonia.<br>
Funeral services were conducted at the Methodist church Monday at 2 p. m. by 
Rev. W. J. Cherry and the burial occurred at Maplewood Cemetery.<br>
Mrs. Thomas was born April 14, 1849, and was married January 18, 1868. She was a 
Miss Rose before her marriage, and was a sister of Robert Rose, of the 8th 
district and Ben Rose, of Pulaski. She was a good woman, whose heart was full of 
the milk of human kindness, and did much for the suffering and distressed.<br>
We extend sympathy to the bereaved husband and other relatives.<br>
<br>
THOMAS, Mitchell McKinley The Pulaski Citizen 5 Apr 1900<br>
Mitchell McKinley Thomas, of the firm of Thomas &amp; Prince, after a short illness 
of pneumonia, died at his home on North First Street Thursday night, March 29, 
at a quarter to twelve o'clock, aged 58 years, 6 months, and 23 days. After 
funeral services, by Rev. W. J. Cherry, at the Methodist Church Friday. The 
burial took place at Maplewood.<br>
In the death of Mitchell McKinley Thomas, one of Pulaski's best citizens is 
taken from the walks of life. He was a quiet, gentlemanly, kind-hearted man, and 
lived not unto himself alone.<br>
<br>
He as a consistent member of the Methodist Church and also a member of the 
Masonic and Odd Fellow Lodges, and among the many deeds of goodmen which 
characterized the man, was the donation of the site of the Baptist Church.<br>
The death of Mr. Thomas' wife, which occurred about a week before his own, had a 
depressing effect on him, and he seemed to lose interest in his own, condition 
and worldly affairs.<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas being childless the bulk of their property will go to 
relatives and a foster child.<br>
In regard to the Thomas property, most of the real estate, especially town 
property, belonged to Mrs. Thomas and goes to her brothers and sisters, she 
having made no will.<br>
Mr. Thomas willed his interest in the Thomas &amp; Prince to his foster child, Mrs. 
Ida Ingram, also $2,000 of such other property as he might die possessed of.<br>
<br>
TOPP, Lucretia Gordon The Pulaski Citizen 15 Mar 1900<br>
Lynnville---Rarely has the death of any one created such genuine sorrow as did 
that of Mrs. Lucretia Gordon Topp, wife of Hugh C. Topp, which occurred at the 
old homestead Sunday night at 12 o'clock. About a month ago she was taken 
violently ill with heart trouble, followed by pneumonia. She battled bravely 
against the diseases, but in vain. Her frail constitution could not withstand 
longer the combined attack, and she fell asleep as peacefully as a tired child. 
She was the youngest daugher of Col. Thomas K. Gordon, a leader in his day for 
everything that was for the uplifting of humanity and the good of his fellow 
man. Her husband was Mr. Hugh C. Topp, and six children: Wallace, Hugh C., Jr., 
Anne Lacey, Lucia, Gordon and Helen, are left, besides two sisters, Mrs. Nitia 
G. White of Nashville and Mrs. Helen G. Walker, and five brothers, F. M., Col. 
T. M., Capt E. H. T., Col. W. W. and M. B. L. Gordon. Touching funeral services 
were held at the residence Tuesday morning, after which she was tenderly laid to 
rest in the family graveyard. A large crowd of people attested by their presence 
the high esteem in which she was held. The deceased possessed one of those 
beautiful Christian characters that lived only to benefit her fellow beings, and 
even in her last moments she thought only of the sorrowing ones and prayed that 
they might be comforted. She was beloved and honored by all-by the rich and poor 
alike-by all who came within the radius of her life. She leaves a rich heritage, 
the memory of a perfect womanhood. A host of friends who loved and admired her 
extend to the sorrowing ones their heartfelt sympathy in their hour of trial.<br>
<br>
TOPP, T. M. The Pulaski Citizen 1 Mar 1900<br>
Capt. T. M. Topp, a former resident of this county, and brother of H. C. Topp, 
died at his home near San Bernardino, Calif., Feb. 16. Capt. Topp was born in 
Pulaski Nov. 20, 1831; was married to Miss Lazinka Buford Marcy 20, 1861. Moved 
from Giles County to California Dec. 18, 1864. He was hurt some time ago, from 
the effects of which he suffered a partial paralysis, and never regained his 
former health. Friends of the family will sympathize with Mr. Topp, who is now 
very anxious about the condition of Mrs. Topp, who is suffering from heart 
trouble.<br>
<br>
TUCKER, David The Pulaski Citizen 25 Aug 1909<br>

Christian Church.<br>
He is survived by his wife who is the daughter of Amos Thigpen, and ten 
children.<br>
<br>
TUCKER, Lula The Pulaski Citizen 1 Mar 1900<br>
Heron-The long expected has happened in the death of Miss Lula Tucker, which was 
no dout welcome to her, but yet sad and sorrowful to relatives and many friends. 
She died Feb. 25th, and was buried beside sisters and brothers who had gone on 
before the realms of the eternal God the object of her devotion. During the 
thirty years of life the deceased was a quiet modest unassuming young lady, 
deeply attached to her widowed mother, brothers and her home. It may be truly 
said, she was never heard to utter a harsh word toward anyone, which fact, of 
itself will ever remain as a monument to her memory. It was a pathetic scene 
indeed to see her carried from her home to the grave leaving an invalid mother 
prostrated on a bed of affliction.<br>
<br>
WATSON, George Allen The Pulaski Citizen 08 May 1913<br>
After being ill for several months, Geo. Allen Watson died at his home near

WATSON, Margaret Frances Story The Pulaski Citizen 27 Dec 1917<br>
<br>
WOODROW &quot;Dr. Love&quot;<br>
Mrs. Fannie Watson is no more. A short time ago we wrote up the Watsons reunion 
and also a sketch of this subject and we heard that she was well pleased with 
what we said and now it will not be necessary to repeat some things said on that 
occasion. On Wednesday night, Dec. 19, 1917, death came to this home and robbed 
it of the greatest Jewel that had ever shone there. It was the mother. And like 
a thief in the night he did not tarry but claimed his own in abut thirty minutes 
time after her had his final call. When stricken she called for help and told 
the family she was dying. The end came about eleven o'clock. This was a great 
shock to all of her children who were not expecting her death, and also her 
friends. Heart failure was the cause. Another loving voice is hushed in silence, 
and her long days work has been well done. And while the children cannot come 
home to see their mother any more they can have another family reunion on a 
brighter shore. She was sixty seven years old on Sept. 15 and was the last 
charter member of the Presbyterian Church at the Chapel that was organized in 
1872 and where her body was conveyed to its last resting place Thursday 
afternoon, where a large crowd of sympathizing friends had assembled. Re. J. T. 
Wade conducted services, while Miss May McCracken presided at the organ. On 
arriving at the Chapel the first members of the family that we met were Mrs. 
Maxie Aymett and Mrs. Lucy Curtis with their husbands. The girls represented the 
picture of grief, and when we shook hands with them all, Maxie said, &quot;Mr. Turner 
this is awful.&quot; They reminded me of our Saviour as he stood by the grave weeping 
for those he loved. So in him we have the picture of both human and divine 
blended in grief and to us this is a beautiful picture. In fact, we have seen 
worse pictures in this world than that of grief. And we decided that is good for 
us to sometimes have the fountain of grief opened up in our souls, while tears 
unbidden flow, for it brings us down to where we can look up to Him and say in 
pensive tones, Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy name, They Kingdom 
come Thy will be done, On Earth as it is in Heaven.&quot; Peace and love were the 
dominant traits in her character and the life of Mrs. Watson had been as 
tranquil, smooth, as a calm sea, and like the rose of summer had shed its 
fragrances on all who come in contact with her, one gave to the world some noble 
sons and daughters to be our friends and neighbors. And we hope that the dear 
friends will realize that to her death was only the gateway to the morning of 
eternal day, where she will bloom forever.<br>

<br>
WRIGHT, J. J. The Pulaski Citizen 22 Mar 1900<br>
The uncertainity of life received a sad and impressive illustration in the 
sudden death of J. J. Wright Tuesday evening. He appeared well as usual and was 
very jovial and cheerful at dinner and during the afternoon. He went in at 
Nester's and ordered some oysters sent up for supper late in the afternoon, and 
to a friend who remarked upon his looking well, said, &quot;Yes, I feel first rate.&quot; 
His wife was at home watching for him, and when she saw him coming up the street 
about six o'clock, the usual hour for him to come home, she went back to the 
kitchen and gave the order to have supper. Directly she was informed that a man 
had fallen and the people were running to him. She picked up a bottle of camphor 
and ran down the street, to find her husband in a dying condition. He recognized 
her, called her by name, said he was cold, and asked if this meant death. 
Several overcoats were wrapped about him, he murmured a few words of prayer and 
then his voice ceased, while the body was being carried into the house. Dr. 
Wilson who was called by telephone reached the house even before the body was 
placed on the bed, but a hasty examination showed there was nothing to be done. 
The heart's action had ceased. The distress of the young wife was pitiable in 
the extreme, and many sympathetic tears were shed by those whose voices were 
choked with emotion.<br>
The cause of death is supposed to have been acute rheumatism of the heart. The 
funeral was conducted at the Methodist Church yesterday afternoon by Rev. W. J. 
Cherry attended by the Knights of Pythias in a body. After the funeral the 
remains were accompanied to the depot and escorted by a committee from the Lodge 
to Franklin, Tenn., the former home of Mrs. Wright.-<br>
J. J. Wright was born at Mt. Gilead, Ohio, Feb. 13, 1870. He came south on 
account of his health, having suffered a severe attack of acute rheumatism. He 
located first at Franklin, and later in 1906, moved to Pulaski, since which time 
he has made his home here.<br>
He was a tailor by trade, a modest, unassuming, kind hearted Christian 
gentleman. He was a zealous member of the Methodist church, sang regularly in 
the choir, having a good bass voice, and was very seldom absent from services.<br>
